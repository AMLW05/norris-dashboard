# Project Management Skills Progression
## Drew Norris AI/IT Program

**Purpose**: Layer PM skills progressively across courses to prepare students for CTS-289 capstone project management

## Program PM Philosophy

**Process over Product** - Students learn PM by DOING project management throughout:
- Managing their own learning projects
- Using GitHub as PM tool (issues = backlog, PRs = deliverables)
- Iterating based on retrospectives
- Building from simple to complex PM concepts

## Integration Strategy

### For Each Course Module:
1. **PM Concept Introduction**: 5-10 minute mini-lesson on new PM concept
2. **Apply to Current Work**: Students use concept immediately in their project
3. **Reflect in Retrospective**: How did this PM practice help/hinder?
4. **Iterate**: Improve PM process in next sprint

### Assessment Integration:
- **Process Points**: 20-30% of grade based on PM practices
- **PM Artifacts**: Graded alongside technical deliverables
- **Retrospective Quality**: Shows depth of PM understanding
- **Process Improvement**: Reward students who adapt based on retros

### Drew's Pedagogy Alignment:
- **Process over Product**: PM practices ARE the process
- **Sacred Flow**: Expands to full Scrum workflow
- **Failure as Exercise**: Retrospectives normalize learning from mistakes
- **My Favorite Mistakes**: PM gives vocabulary to discuss failures constructively
