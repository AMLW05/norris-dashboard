## Grading Policies

### Late Work
- 10% deduction per day late (up to 3 days)
- After 3 days: 50% maximum grade
- Sprint deliverables cannot be more than 1 week late (defeats sprint purpose)

### Revision Policy
- Assignments < 70%: One revision opportunity within 1 week
- Must meet with instructor to discuss improvements
- Maximum grade after revision: 85%

### Process Grading Philosophy
**Process points are NOT**:
- Busywork
- Optional extras
- Less important than technical

**Process points ARE**:
- Evidence of professional work habits
- Practice for systems analysis capstone (CTS-285/289)
- Skills employers value
- Foundation for managing complex projects

### AI Collaboration Requirements
**Required for ALL assignments**:
- `prompts.txt` file documenting all AI interactions
- Format: [Prompt] → [AI Response Summary] → [What I learned]
- Grading: Must explain code in your own words

**Philosophy**: AI helps you learn, not replaces learning
- Using AI without understanding: Plagiarism
- Using AI to learn faster: Professional skill

### Velocity Expectations
**Sprint 1** (Linked Lists): No expectations, establishing baseline
**Sprint 2** (Hash Tables): Within 20% of Sprint 1 velocity
**Sprint 3** (Trees): Velocity should stabilize (±10% variation normal)
**Sprint 4** (Graphs): Process becomes automatic

### Standups Expectations
- Minimum 5 entries per sprint (one per work day)
- Brief format: Yesterday / Today / Blockers / Burndown
- Honest (saying "struggled" is better than saying nothing)

## Academic Integrity

**Collaboration Encouraged**:
- Discussing data structure concepts
- Helping debug (not writing code for others)
- Sharing AI prompts and learning strategies
- Peer review of approach

**Not Allowed**:
- Copying code from classmates or internet
- Sharing complete solution files
- Using AI to generate code you don't understand
- Submitting code you can't explain

**AI Collaboration**:
- MUST document all AI interactions in prompts.txt
- MUST be able to explain every line of code
- Using AI without understanding = Academic dishonesty
- Generic/template prompts obvious and unacceptable

**PM Artifacts**:
- Must be YOUR sprint, YOUR velocity, YOUR retrospective
- Generic/template responses obvious and unacceptable

---

## Language Choice (C++ or Python)

Students may complete assignments in **C++ OR Python**.

**Grading Equivalency**:
- C++ pointers/memory management = Python efficiency/optimization
- Both require understanding of underlying concepts
- Complexity analysis applies to both languages

**Expectations**:
- **C++**: Proper memory management, no memory leaks, templates
- **Python**: Clean code, efficient implementations, type hints

---

## Knowledge Checks (8 @ 6.25 points)

**Format**: 10 questions each, Canvas quiz
**Topics**: Module concepts and Big O notation
**Attempts**: 2 attempts, highest score counts
**Time Limit**: 20 minutes

**Sample Questions**:
- What is the time complexity of searching a binary search tree? (Big O)
- Which data structure provides O(1) average case insertion? (Hash table)
- What traversal visits left subtree, root, then right subtree? (Inorder)

---

## Participation (25 points)

**GitHub Pull Request Reviews (15 pts)**:
- Minimum 4 meaningful PR reviews across semester
- Must provide constructive feedback
- Focus on code quality, testing, documentation

**AI Prompt Sharing (10 pts)**:
