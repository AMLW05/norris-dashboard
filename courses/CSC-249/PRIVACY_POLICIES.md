- ❌ Copyrighted code from other sources

**AI Tools (Claude/ChatGPT/Copilot)**:
- ✅ Assignment code and questions
- ✅ Error messages and debugging help
- ❌ Personal identifying information
- ❌ Other students' code (academic integrity)

**Discord**:
- ✅ Questions about course content
- ✅ Code snippets (not full solutions)
- ❌ Full assignment solutions

## Your Rights (General)

Under various privacy laws (FERPA, GDPR if applicable), you have rights including:

1. **Right to Access**: Request copies of data collected about you
2. **Right to Deletion**: Request deletion of your data (with some exceptions for educational records)
3. **Right to Opt-Out**: Opt out of data collection/processing where possible
4. **Right to Correction**: Correct inaccurate data

**How to Exercise Rights**:
- **GitHub**: Contact GitHub support or use account settings
- **AI Tools**: Use account settings or contact company support
- **Educational Records**: Contact [INSTITUTION: Add registrar/FERPA office contact]

## Educational Records (FERPA)

**What's Protected**: Your grades, assignment submissions, instructor communications are protected by FERPA.

**Who Can Access**:
- You (the student)
- Instructor and authorized university officials
- NOT: Other students, parents (without your consent), external parties

**GitHub Considerations**:
- Private repositories = only you and instructor can see
- Public repositories = anyone can see (don't make assignments public during course)
- After course ends, you can make portfolio pieces public

**More Information**: [INSTITUTION: Add FERPA information page URL]

## Questions or Concerns?

**Privacy-related questions**: Contact instructor at [INSTRUCTOR: Add email]

**Institutional privacy office**: [INSTITUTION: Add privacy officer contact]
