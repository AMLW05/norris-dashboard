## 7. When to Seek Help

### ✅ Good times to ask for help:
- After trying for 30+ minutes and documenting attempts
- When error messages don't make sense after researching
- Before sprint deadline if falling behind
- When struggling with PM process (sprint planning, standups)
- If personal issues affect ability to complete work

### ⚠️ Times to try more first:
- Haven't started the assignment yet
- Haven't read the assignment instructions
- Haven't looked at reference materials or troubleshooting guide
- Haven't asked AI for clarification
- It's 2 hours before the deadline (start earlier!)

### 🚨 Emergency situations (seek help immediately):
- Mental health crisis → Counseling 24/7 line or 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
- Accommodation need for upcoming exam → Disability Services ASAP
- Falling multiple weeks behind → Email instructor + academic advisor
- Technology completely broken with deadline approaching → IT Help Desk

### Weeks 9-16 (Sprint Cycles & Capstone)
- Daily standups keep you accountable
- Retrospectives identify what to improve
- Office hours for sprint planning guidance
- Don't struggle alone - ask for help early

## 9. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use AI to do my homework?**
A: Yes! AI collaboration is REQUIRED. But you must understand and document it in prompts.txt. Code you can't explain = plagiarism.

**Q: How much help is "too much help" in Discord?**
A: Share concepts, debugging strategies, and hints. Don't share complete solutions. "Try checking if the pointer is null" ✓ vs "Here's my whole linked list code" ✗

**Q: I'm falling behind. What do I do?**
A: Email instructor immediately. Options: extension, reduced scope, modified deadlines. Communication = solutions.

**Q: The sprint process feels like busywork. Do I have to do it?**
A: Yes. It's 40% of your grade and teaches professional practices. By Sprint 3, you'll see why it works.

**Q: Can I switch from C++ to Python mid-semester?**
A: Yes, but ideally decide by Week 3. Switching later means redoing earlier assignments.

**Q: I have a disability accommodation. How do I use it?**
A: Register with Disability Services → Get accommodation letter → Meet with instructor to discuss implementation.
