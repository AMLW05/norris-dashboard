## QM Audit Summary

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Learning Objective Alignment**: CLOs → MLOs → Assessments → Activities is transparent and measurable.

2. **Experiential Learning Design**: Students build real systems, not toy examples. Portfolio-worthy outcomes.

3. **Clear Grading Standards**: Rubrics with examples eliminate ambiguity. 40-40-20 split (Process-Technical-Communication) is well-justified.

4. **Instructor Support**: SME instructors can teach this course effectively with provided materials (Instructor Guide, grading shortcuts).

5. **Accessibility**: Free tools, clear documentation, accommodation support.

6. **Assessment Variety**: Multiple ways to demonstrate learning (not just exams).

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Video Content**: Consider adding 5-minute video walkthroughs of complex topics (UML notation, normalization) for students who prefer visual learning.

2. **Example Projects**: Include 1-2 complete example projects from previous semesters as reference.

3. **Mobile Optimization**: Verify Canvas HTML pages render well on mobile devices.
