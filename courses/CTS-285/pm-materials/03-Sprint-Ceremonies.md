# PM Mini-Lesson: Sprint Ceremonies
## 10-Minute Embeddable Lesson

**When to use**: Week 5-6 (Module 3 - First Sprint)
**Duration**: 10 minutes

## The Four Scrum Ceremonies

Every sprint has four key meetings (ceremonies):

1. **Sprint Planning** (beginning of sprint)
2. **Daily Standup** (every day during sprint)
3. **Sprint Review** (end of sprint)
4. **Sprint Retrospective** (end of sprint, after review)

---

## 1. Sprint Planning

**When**: First day of sprint
**Duration**: 1-2 hours (for 2-week sprint)
**Who**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Team
**Goal**: Decide what work will be done this sprint

**Outputs**:
- Sprint goal (one sentence: what success looks like)
- Selected user stories from backlog
- Story points total (should match team capacity)
- Tasks broken down for each story

**Your solo version**:
- Fill out Sprint Planning Template
- Calculate capacity (hours available)
- Select stories that fit capacity (use velocity from previous sprint)
- Break stories into tasks

## 2. Daily Standup

**When**: Every working day during sprint (same time)
**Duration**: 15 minutes maximum
**Who**: Whole team
**Goal**: Synchronize work, identify blockers

**Three questions each person answers**:
1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. What's blocking me?

**Your solo version**:
- Write standup entry daily (not at end of sprint!)
- Answer three questions
- Update burndown chart
- Note blockers (even if it's "spent 2 hours stuck on authentication")

**Why solo standups matter**:
- Creates daily accountability
- Documents your process (40% of grade!)
- Prepares you for CTS-289 where you'll coordinate with GRD-242 partner
- Helps you spot patterns ("I'm blocked every Wednesday afternoon - that's when I have 3 other classes")

## 3. Sprint Review

**When**: Last day of sprint
**Duration**: 1 hour
**Who**: Team + stakeholders (people who care about product)
**Goal**: Demo working software, get feedback

**Structure**:
1. Remind everyone what sprint goal was (1 min)
2. Demo features completed (5-10 min)
3. Stakeholders ask questions, give feedback (10 min)
4. Discuss what's next (5 min)

**Your version**:
- Present to class (5-7 minutes)
- Demo working features
- Answer questions
- Document feedback for next sprint

**Key**: Demo WORKING software. Not slides about what you plan to do. Show it running.

## 4. Sprint Retrospective

**When**: After sprint review
**Duration**: 45 minutes to 1 hour
**Who**: Team only (no stakeholders - this is internal)
**Goal**: Improve process

**Three questions**:
1. What went well?
2. What didn't go well?
3. What will we change next sprint?

**Your version**:
- Fill out Sprint Retrospective Template
- Be honest (fake retrospectives don't help you improve)
- Make changes actionable ("Front-load research tasks on Day 1-2" not "work harder")

**Why retrospectives matter**:
- Sprint 2 should be smoother than Sprint 1 (you learned something!)
- Continuous improvement is the heart of Agile
- 5 points bonus per sprint for good retrospectives

## Ceremony Schedule (2-Week Sprint)

**Week 1, Day 1**: Sprint Planning
**Week 1, Days 2-5**: Daily Standups
**Week 2, Days 1-4**: Daily Standups
**Week 2, Day 5**: Sprint Review + Sprint Retrospective

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Skipping standups**: "I'll write them all on Day 10"
✅ **Do this**: Write them daily. Set a reminder. 5 minutes per day.

❌ **Fake retrospectives**: "Everything went great!"
✅ **Do this**: "I underestimated ERD design by 3 hours. Next sprint I'll research normalization before designing."

❌ **Sprint review is slides only**: "Here's what I plan to build..."
✅ **Do this**: "Let me show you the working login feature. Click here, enter email, and you're logged in."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Sprint Planning**: Decide what to do (fill template, select stories)
2. **Daily Standup**: Sync daily (3 questions, update burndown)
3. **Sprint Review**: Demo working software (not plans)
4. **Sprint Retrospective**: Learn and improve (honest reflection)

**You'll do all four ceremonies for Sprints 1, 2, and 3!**
