**Application**: Create stakeholder register for capstone project

**Deliverable**: Stakeholder Matrix
| Stakeholder | Interest | Influence | Communication Strategy |
|-------------|----------|-----------|----------------------|

#### 3. **Epic & Theme Management**
**When**: Module 3 (Design phase)
**Concept**: Large features broken into multiple stories
**Activity**: Group AlgoCratic features into epics
**Application**: Organize capstone backlog by epics

**Example Epic Structure**:
```
📦 Epic: User Authentication System
├── User Story: User registration
├── User Story: Login/logout
├── User Story: Password reset
└── User Story: Profile management

📦 Epic: AI Chat Interface
├── User Story: Basic conversation
├── User Story: Conversation history
└── User Story: Export chat
```

**Mini-Lesson**: "From Vision to Epics to Stories" (10 min)
- Product vision (big picture)
- Themes (categories of work)
- Epics (large features)
- Stories (implementable chunks)

---

#### 4. **Risk Management**
**When**: Module 4 (throughout project)
**Concept**: What could go wrong? How do we respond?
**Activity**: Risk brainstorming for AlgoCratic scenarios
**Application**: Create and maintain risk register

**Risk Register Template**:
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Response | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| API rate limits hit | Medium | High | 15 | Implement caching | Me |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | 15 | Use change control | Me |
| Third-party API changes | Low | High | 10 | Version pinning, monitoring | Me |

**Risk Response Strategies**:
- **Avoid**: Change plan to eliminate risk
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
- **Transfer**: Use service/insurance to handle
- **Accept**: Acknowledge, have contingency plan

**Mini-Lesson**: "Risk Management for Tech Projects" (15 min)

---

#### 5. **MVP Definition & Release Planning**
**When**: Module 5 (Prototyping)
**Concept**: What's the minimum viable product? How do we get there?
**Activity**: Define MVP for AlgoCratic system
**Application**: Plan 3-sprint release roadmap for capstone

**MVP Canvas**:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Target User         │ Who is this for?
├─────────────────────┤
│ Core Problem        │ What problem does it solve?
├─────────────────────┤
│ Must-Have Features  │ Absolute minimum
├─────────────────────┤
│ Success Metrics     │ How do we know it works?
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Release Roadmap** (3 sprints):
- **Sprint 1 (MVP)**: Core functionality, basic UI
- **Sprint 2 (Enhancements)**: Improved UX, error handling
- **Sprint 3 (Polish)**: Performance, edge cases, documentation

**Mini-Lesson**: "Building MVP: Features vs. Gold-Plating" (10 min)

---

#### 6. **MoSCoW Prioritization**
**When**: Throughout course
**Concept**: Ruthless prioritization of features

**MoSCoW Method**:
- **Must Have**: Non-negotiable, project fails without it
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Nice to have if time permits
- **Won't Have** (this time): Explicitly out of scope

**Example for AI Tutor**:
- **Must**: Basic chat, AI responses, conversation history
- **Should**: Export chat, save favorites, customization
- **Could**: Voice input, multilingual, analytics
- **Won't**: Video chat, AR/VR interface

**Activity**: MoSCoW your AlgoCratic and capstone backlogs
