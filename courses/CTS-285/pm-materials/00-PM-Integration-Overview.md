# PM Integration Overview
## CTS-285: Systems Analysis & Design

**Purpose**: This document explains how project management (PM) concepts are woven throughout CTS-285 and why they matter for your career development and CTS-289 preparation.

---

## Why PM in a Systems Analysis Course?

**Short answer**: Because software projects fail more often from poor process than poor code.

**Real answer**: In CTS-289, you'll collaborate with GRD-242 (graphic design) students on a capstone project with minimal instructor guidance. You need to:
- Coordinate across disciplines (technical + creative)
- Manage scope, timeline, and expectations
- Communicate progress to non-technical stakeholders
- Navigate conflicts and changing requirements
- Deliver working software on deadline

**PM skills make this possible.** Technical skills alone won't get you there.

## The 40-60% PM Grading Model

CTS-285 uses a **40% Process + 40% Technical + 20% Communication** grading split.

### What This Means

**40% Process/PM**:
- Evidence you followed SDLC phases (not just jumped to coding)
- Sprint planning, daily standups, retrospectives
- User story quality and backlog management
- Risk identification and mitigation
- GitHub Projects board usage
- Iterative work visible through commits

**40% Technical**:
- System design quality (UML, ERD, wireframes)
- Code functionality and quality
- Testing and deployment
- Appropriate tool usage

**20% Communication**:
- Documentation clarity (for technical AND non-technical readers)
- Design rationale and trade-off explanations
- Presentation skills
- Professional writing

### Why This Split?

Industry data shows:
- 68% of software projects fail due to **poor requirements, scope creep, or communication breakdowns** (process issues)
- 32% fail due to technical problems

Our grading reflects professional reality.

## How PM Integrates with Technical Work

### They're Not Separate

**Bad mental model**: "Do PM stuff, then do technical stuff"

**Good mental model**: "PM practices guide how I do technical work"

### Examples

**Writing code WITHOUT PM practices**:
- Jump straight to coding
- No requirements clarity
- Build whatever seems cool
- Realize halfway through it doesn't solve user problem
- No tests, documentation, or commit discipline
- Deploy and hope for best

**Result**: Works on your machine, breaks for users, unmaintainable

**Writing code WITH PM practices**:
- Start with user story ("As a student, I want to filter events by date...")
- Write acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- Estimate effort (3 story points)
- Create GitHub issue, assign to sprint
- Branch from main (`feature/event-date-filter`)
- Write tests for acceptance criteria
- Implement feature
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Update standup (blocker: API doesn't return dates in consistent format)
- Solve blocker, document solution
- Pull request with description
- Move issue to Done
- Update sprint board

**Result**: Traceable, testable, maintainable, professional

## Common Student Questions

### "Why do I need standups if I'm working solo?"

**Answer**: Two reasons:

1. **Practice for CTS-289** where you'll coordinate with GRD-242 partner. Async standups (like we do in discussion boards) are how remote teams coordinate.

2. **Accountability to yourself**. Daily standups force you to articulate progress and blockers. Students who do this consistently finish sprints on time. Students who skip them realize on Day 9 they haven't started.

### "Can I skip the process stuff and just build a great project?"

**Answer**: No, because:

1. **Process IS part of "great"** in professional development. A project with no documentation, no tests, and no requirements traceability isn't great - it's a tech demo.

2. **Grading reflects this** - 40% of your grade. Skipping process = maximum possible grade is 60% (D).

3. **You won't learn what you need for CTS-289**. The capstone will be much harder without process discipline.

### "I'm a developer, not a project manager. Why do I need Scrum Master skills?"

**Answer**: Because **developers who understand PM are more valuable**.

In industry:
- Junior dev: Takes tasks, writes code
- Mid-level dev: Takes tasks, writes code, mentors juniors
- **Senior dev**: Defines tasks (writes user stories), leads sprints, makes architecture decisions, communicates with stakeholders

PM skills = career advancement.

Plus, in small teams (startups, small IT departments), developers wear multiple hats. You'll be glad you know this.

### "The Algocratic theme is confusing. Do I need to engage with it?"

**Answer**: **No.** It's optional engagement for students who enjoy the satire.

Grading is based on learning objectives only. You can ignore every collapsible "AlgoCratic Lens" section and still earn an A.

If it helps you engage, great. If it distracts, skip it.

### "When will I use this in real life?"

**Answer**: Immediately in CTS-289, then constantly in your career.

**CTS-289**: You'll use user stories to communicate with GRD-242 partner, sprint planning to organize your capstone timeline, retrospectives to improve collaboration.

**Internship/First Job**: Employers expect you to know Agile/Scrum. "Experience with sprint planning and user stories" is on most job descriptions for junior developers.

**5 Years In**: You'll be teaching this to someone else.

## Success Strategies

### 1. **Trust the Templates**

The planning sheets (sprint planning, standups, retrospectives) aren't busywork - they're scaffolding. Use them exactly as provided for first 2 sprints. By Sprint 3, you'll internalize the patterns.

### 2. **Do the Retrospectives Seriously**

Students who skip retros make the same mistakes every sprint. Students who reflect and act on improvements see visible growth.

**5 minutes of honest reflection saves hours of repeated mistakes.**

### 3. **Track Process Visibly**

Use GitHub Projects boards actively. Moving issues across columns feels satisfying and provides evidence of your process for grading.

Plus, it's impressive to show in interviews: "Here's my semester project board with 45 issues tracked across 3 sprints..."

### 4. **Ask "Why" Before "How"**

Before implementing a feature, ask:
- **Why** does the user need this? (user story benefit)
- **Why** this approach over alternatives? (design rationale)
- **Why** is this prioritized now? (backlog ordering)

This is systems thinking - the core of systems analysis.

### 5. **Communicate Like Your Audience Doesn't Code**

Because in CTS-289, they won't. GRD-242 students are designers, not developers.

Practice explaining technical decisions in plain language. Your Module 7 documentation should be readable by your mom (or a graphic designer).

## PM Mini-Lessons

Throughout the course, you'll encounter 10-minute mini-lessons on specific PM topics:

1. **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria** (Module 2)
2. **Story Point Estimation** (Module 3)
3. **Sprint Ceremonies** (Module 3)
4. **Burndown Charts** (Module 4)
5. **Risk Assessment** (Module 6)

These are embedded in assignments when concepts are first introduced. They're short, practical, and immediately applicable.

## Measuring Your PM Growth

### By End of Module 4, You Should:
- Write user stories fluently
- Estimate effort (story points) with reasonable accuracy
- Plan and execute a 2-week sprint
- Facilitate basic sprint ceremonies
- Track progress with burndown charts

### By End of Module 8, You Should:
- Run sprints independently with minimal guidance
- Manage stakeholder expectations and scope changes
- Identify and mitigate project risks
- Communicate technical work to non-technical audiences
- Document process decisions and rationale
- Reflect on and improve your process continuously

### How to Self-Assess:

**Question**: "Could I lead a CTS-289 capstone sprint with a GRD-242 partner right now?"

- **Module 4**: "With heavy instructor support, yes"
- **Module 6**: "With occasional check-ins, yes"
- **Module 8**: "Independently, yes"

If your answer doesn't match this progression, talk to instructor about additional practice.

## Connection to Program Outcomes

PM integration directly supports:

- **PO1** (Git/GitHub workflow): Sprint work requires consistent commits and branching
- **PO3** (Analyze systems): User stories and requirements analysis are systems analysis
- **PO4** (Document and communicate): Documentation and stakeholder communication are core PM skills
- **PO5** (Process-first mindset): PM IS the process-first approach

You're not learning PM separate from technical work - **PM is the framework for professional technical work**.

## For CTS-289 Instructors

Students completing CTS-285 should arrive in capstone with:

✅ User story writing fluency
✅ Sprint planning and execution experience (3 complete sprints)
✅ GitHub Projects board proficiency
✅ Retrospective and continuous improvement habits
✅ Cross-functional communication practice (technical ↔ non-technical)
✅ Risk identification and mitigation skills
✅ Documentation for multiple audiences (technical + user-facing)
✅ Presentation skills (sprint reviews practiced 3 times)

**What they still need to develop in 289**:
- Working with actual non-technical partner (GRD-242 students)
- Managing interpersonal conflicts and team dynamics
- Negotiating real scope/timeline trade-offs with external stakeholder
- True autonomous project execution (CTS-285 still has safety net)

## Questions?

- **Office hours**: Check Canvas for current schedule
- **Discussion board**: "PM Questions" forum
- **Email**: For specific project questions

**Remember**: Process over product. The journey matters as much as the destination.
