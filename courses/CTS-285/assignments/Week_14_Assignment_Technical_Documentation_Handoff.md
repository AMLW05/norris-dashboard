---

## Learning Objectives

1. **Document** system architecture for technical audience
2. **Create** API documentation (if applicable)
3. **Write** code documentation for future maintainers
4. **Prepare** handoff package for next developer

## Part 1: Technical Architecture Document (20 points)

### Create `architecture.md`

**Include**:
1. **System Overview** (high-level architecture diagram)
2. **Technology Stack** (all libraries/frameworks used)
3. **Database Schema** (updated ERD from Sprint 1)
4. **File Structure** (what each directory/file does)
5. **Key Design Decisions** (why you chose X over Y)
6. **External Dependencies** (APIs, services)

## Andrew's Note

Documentation is love letter to future you (and future developers).

Six months from now, you won't remember why you made that weird database decision. Documentation tells the story.
