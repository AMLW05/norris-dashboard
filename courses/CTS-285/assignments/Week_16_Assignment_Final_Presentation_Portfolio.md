## Andrew's Note

**This is it. Your semester in 10 minutes.**

I've seen presentations that made me want to use the app immediately. I've seen presentations where students got choked up talking about how hard they worked.

Both got A's. Because they **told their story authentically**.

### What Makes a Great Final Presentation:

**Not this**: "I built an event system. It has login and search. The end."

**This**: "College students miss 70% of campus events because information is scattered. I've personally missed job fairs, free food, and networking events. So I built a centralized event discovery system that solves this. Let me show you... [demo]... Building this taught me that design is 10% of the work and implementation is 90%. I underestimated story points every sprint until Sprint 3. But I learned. That's the point."

**You're not showing me code. You're showing me growth.**

### After This Course:

You're ready for CTS-289. You know how to:
- Plan and execute sprints independently
- Communicate with non-technical stakeholders (you'll need this with GRD-242 students)
- Manage risks and scope
- Build something real, not just toy projects

**You've earned this.** Go show everyone what you built.

See you at final presentations. Can't wait to see what you've created.
