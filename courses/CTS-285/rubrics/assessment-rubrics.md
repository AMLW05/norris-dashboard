# CTS-285 Assessment Rubrics
## Systems Analysis & Design - Fall 2026

## Philosophy: Process + Product = Professional Practice

CTS-285 emphasizes **how you work** as much as **what you produce**. Our grading reflects this:

- **40% Process/PM** - Evidence of SDLC phases, sprint execution, documentation
- **40% Technical** - Quality of design, implementation, system functionality
- **20% Communication** - Written docs, presentations, stakeholder interaction

**Why this split?** In CTS-289, you'll work with GRD-242 (graphic design) students. Process clarity and communication determine project success as much as technical skill.

| **Completeness** | All sections complete, follows instructions precisely | All major sections complete, minor omissions | Key sections complete, some requirements missed | Multiple sections incomplete or missing | 10% |

### Examples by Grade Level

**A-Level Work (90-100%)**:
- GitHub repository organized with clear folder structure
- README explains project purpose and how to run it
- All deliverables exceed minimum (e.g., asked for 3 user stories, provided 5 well-crafted ones)
- Documentation includes "why" decisions were made, not just "what"
- Evidence of iterative work (multiple commits over time, not one giant commit)

**B-Level Work (80-89%)**:
- All required deliverables present and functional
- Documentation adequate but lacks depth in places
- Some evidence of process (commits, notes) but not comprehensive
- Writing is clear but may have minor issues
- Meets requirements but doesn't exceed them

**C-Level Work (70-79%)**:
- Most deliverables present, may have quality issues
- Limited process documentation (e.g., fake standups written all at once)
- Explanations brief or unclear in places
- Meets minimum requirements barely
- Work appears rushed or incomplete

**Below 70%**:
- Missing significant deliverables
- No evidence of following process
- Poor communication or unprofessional presentation
- Does not meet minimum requirements

## Retrospective Rubric

Used after each sprint (bonus 5 points) and Module 8 final reflection.

| Criteria | Excellent (5) | Proficient (4) | Developing (3) | Needs Work (<3) |
|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Honesty** | Real struggles shared, celebrates actual wins, authentic | Mostly honest, some generic statements | Mostly generic, "everything was fine" tone | Clearly not reflective or dishonest |

| **Growth Mindset** | Frames challenges as learning, takes ownership | Acknowledges learning, mostly constructive | Some blame or negative framing | Blames external factors, no learning evident |

### Good vs. Poor Retrospective Examples

**Good - "What Went Well"**:
> "Breaking the ERD design into smaller tasks (Monday: list entities, Tuesday: define relationships) helped me avoid feeling overwhelmed. Commit on Tuesday showed 3 entities designed. This incremental approach reduced my design paralysis."

**Poor - "What Went Well"**:
> "Everything went well. I finished on time."

**Good - "What Will I Change"**:
> "Next sprint I'll front-load research tasks on Day 1-2. This sprint I got blocked on Day 5 trying to decide between Flask-SQLAlchemy vs. raw SQL, wasting 3 hours. Moving research earlier prevents mid-sprint blocking."

**Poor - "What Will I Change"**:
> "I'll work harder and manage my time better."

## Grading Scale & Policies

### Letter Grade Conversion

| Grade | Percentage | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| A | 90-100% | Excellent mastery of SDLC, Agile practices, and systems analysis |
| B | 80-89% | Strong understanding, proficient execution, minor gaps |
| C | 70-79% | Adequate foundation, meets minimum requirements, needs growth |
| D | 60-69% | Significant gaps, below expectations for CTS-289 readiness |
| F | <60% | Does not demonstrate minimum competency |

### Late Work Policy

- **Within 24 hours**: -10% penalty
- **24-48 hours**: -20% penalty
- **48-72 hours**: -30% penalty
- **Beyond 72 hours**: Requires instructor approval, up to -50%

**Exceptions**: Sprint work has hard deadlines (can't be "late" - sprints end). Retrospectives can be submitted up to 3 days late with penalty.

### Revision Policy

**Assignments**: One revision allowed within 1 week of grading for up to 80% of original lost points.

**Example**: Earned 70/100 on assignment. Can revise to earn back up to 24 of the 30 lost points (max final score: 94/100).

**Not eligible for revision**: Daily standups (process artifact), final presentation

### Academic Integrity

**Collaboration Encouraged**:
- Discussing concepts and approaches
- Helping with troubleshooting
- Peer code review (required!)
- Using online resources with citation

**Violations (result in 0 and academic integrity report)**:
- Copying another student's work
- Submitting AI-generated work without understanding/attribution
- Using someone else's project as your own
- Fabricating process artifacts (fake standups, fake commits)

**When uncertain, ask first.**

### Participation & Engagement

Not formally graded, but:
- Attending in-class activities provides scaffolding for assignments
- Office hours use correlates with success (students who ask questions earn higher grades)
- Engaging with optional AlgoCratic content doesn't affect grade but may increase enjoyment

## Grading Philosophy: Feedback for Growth

### What We're Looking For

**Process evidence > Perfect products**
- A well-documented design with some flaws beats a perfect design with no process trail
- Standups showing struggle and problem-solving beat fake standups claiming perfection

**Systems thinking > Feature checklists**
- Explaining trade-offs (e.g., "I chose SQLite over PostgreSQL for development speed, knowing I'll migrate later") beats just implementing
- Acknowledging risks and constraints shows professional maturity

**Growth over time > Individual assignment perfection**
- Sprint 2 should show learning from Sprint 1 retrospective
- Estimation accuracy should improve across sprints
- Late-semester work should show more independence

### Common Grading Questions

**Q: "My code works but I didn't do standups. Can I still get an A?"**
A: No. An A requires demonstrating both technical skill AND process. You'd earn ~60% (technical points only), likely a D.

**Q: "I did everything but my ERD isn't perfectly normalized. Will I fail?"**
A: No. Minor technical flaws result in point deductions (maybe 85% instead of 95%) but completeness and process still earn substantial credit.

**Q: "I engaged with all the AlgoCratic optional content. Does that help my grade?"**
A: Not directly - grading is based on learning objectives only. But if you found it motivating and it helped you do better work, indirectly yes!

**Q: "Can I turn in a Sprint 1 design, get feedback, and revise before the deadline?"**
A: Yes! That's encouraged. Come to office hours mid-sprint for design review. Iterative improvement is professional practice.

**Q: "I'm behind. Should I skip the retrospective to focus on technical work?"**
A: No. The retro helps you identify why you're behind and what to change. Plus it's only 5 points but valuable learning.

## For Instructors: Grading Efficiency Tips

### Time-Saving Strategies

**GitHub Projects boards reveal process quality in 30 seconds**:
- Count issues (should match user story count from backlog)
- Check issue movement (columns should show progression)
- Look for labels (story points, priorities)
- Check last update date (active throughout sprint vs. day before deadline)

**Commit history shows work patterns**:
- Multiple commits over sprint = iterative work
- One giant commit = procrastination or poor process
- Commit messages should be descriptive ("Add use case diagram for event management" not "update")

**Standups can be scanned quickly**:
- Look for dates (10 entries over ~10 days?)
- Check for specificity (actual tasks vs. "worked on project")
- Verify blockers acknowledged (nobody has zero blockers - if they claim that, it's fake)

**Rubrics are your friend**:
- Use rubric percentages, not points (easier to scale)
- Grade holistically first (A/B/C feel), then adjust with rubric
- Document patterns (if 8 students make same mistake, it's a teaching gap for next term)

### Grading Workflow (15-20 min per sprint assignment)

1. **Check GitHub Projects board** (2 min) - Process quality snapshot
2. **Scan standups** (3 min) - Look for red flags (fake entries, no progression)
3. **Review technical deliverables** (8 min) - Diagrams, code, functionality
4. **Read design doc/rationale** (5 min) - Do they explain "why"?
5. **Fill rubric and calculate** (2 min)

**Total per student**: ~20 min for 75-100 point sprint assignment = efficient given point value
