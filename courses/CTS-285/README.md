# CTS-285: Systems Analysis & Design
## Fall 2026 | Forsyth Technical Community College

**Instructor**: Andrew Norris
**Credits**: 3 (2 Class | 2 Lab)
**Prerequisites**: None (CTI-110, CTI-120, CTS-115 recommended)
**Course Repository**: [GitHub - norrisaftcc](https://github.com/norrisaftcc)

## Course Description

This course introduces established and evolving methodologies for the analysis, design, and development of an information system. Emphasis is placed on system characteristics, managing projects, prototyping, CASE/OOM tools, and systems development life cycle phases. Upon completion, students should be able to analyze a problem and design an appropriate solution using a combination of tools and techniques.

**Our Approach**: You'll learn the SDLC by building a real information system from scratch across 16 weeks, rotating through project roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer, Release Manager) while practicing Agile/Scrum methodologies that prepare you for CTS-289's capstone collaboration with GRD-242 students.

## Preparing for CTS-289

This course scaffolds skills needed for CTS-289: System Support Project (capstone).

**Skills explicitly developed for capstone**:
- ✅ Written communication (documentation every module)
- ✅ Oral communication (sprint reviews, final presentation)
- ✅ Project definition (requirements gathering, Module 2)
- ✅ Installation/deployment (Module 7)
- ✅ Testing (Module 6)
- ✅ User training materials (Module 7)
- ✅ Working with cross-functional stakeholders (prepares for GRD-242 collaboration)
- ✅ Autonomous project execution (scaffolding decreases each module)

By Module 8, you'll execute a sprint with **minimal instructor assistance**, mirroring the independence required in CTS-289.

## Teaching Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Experiential Learning** - Learn by doing, not just reading about concepts

**2. Process Over Product** - How you work matters as much as what you build

**3. Role Rotation** - Experience all perspectives (PO, SM, Dev, Release Manager) to understand full project lifecycle

**4. Real-World Skills** - Build portfolio-worthy projects using industry tools and practices

**5. Iterative Improvement** - Retrospectives and continuous learning, not perfection

**6. Student Choice** - Select your own project within structure, allowing authentic investment

### AlgoCratic Framework (Optional)

Some course materials include satirical "dystopian corporate" framing (collapsible sections marked 🎭). This is **optional student engagement** - grading is based on learning objectives only. Some students find the theme motivating; others prefer straightforward technical content. Both paths lead to the same competencies.

## Success in This Course

### Time Commitment

- **In-class time**: 4 hours/week (2 hrs lecture, 2 hrs lab)
- **Out-of-class work**: 6-8 hours/week average
  - Varies by module (lighter in Module 1, heavier during sprints)
- **Total**: ~10-12 hours/week

### Tips for Success

**1. Start assignments early** - Sprint work can't be crammed into one day

**2. Use the templates** - Planning sheets, standup formats, retrospectives are scaffolding, not busywork

**3. Commit to GitHub frequently** - Small, frequent commits > one giant commit. Shows process and protects your work.

**4. Attend office hours** - Design review before finalizing diagrams saves time

**5. Take retrospectives seriously** - Your Sprint 2 goes smoother when you learn from Sprint 1

**6. Scope ruthlessly** - MVP means Minimum Viable Product. Cut features liberally. You can always add more later.

**7. Ask questions early** - Stuck for 30+ minutes? Ask. Don't suffer in silence.

**8. Read assignment instructions completely** - Deliverables checklist exists for a reason

## What Past Students Say

> "I thought this would be just theory, but we actually built something I put in my portfolio." - Fall 2025 student

> "The role rotation was brilliant - I understand why PMs and developers clash now, because I've been both." - Spring 2025 student

> "Sprint 1 was hard, but Andrew was right - it gets easier when you trust the process." - Fall 2024 student

> "Working with the GRD students in CTS-289 was so much smoother because I'd practiced stakeholder communication all semester in 285." - Spring 2026 student
