## Comprehensive Systems Analysis Concepts (60%)

### Question 1
You're starting a new project. What's the recommended order of activities?

A) Code first, figure out requirements later
B) Understand requirements, design solution, implement, test, deploy
C) Deploy immediately and iterate
D) Design first without talking to stakeholders

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: This is the SDLC in action. Understand what needs to be solved (analysis/requirements), plan how to solve it (design), build it (implementation), verify it works (testing), and ship it (deployment). Skipping steps creates expensive rework. Professional projects follow this flow, whether Waterfall (sequential) or Agile (iterative cycles). The order matters.

### Question 2
A stakeholder says "I need this feature immediately." What's the most professional response?

A) Drop everything and build it
B) Ask about the business need, assess impact, evaluate trade-offs with current work, then decide together
C) Say no without discussion
D) Ignore the request

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: "Urgent" requests need context. What's the business impact? What gets delayed if we prioritize this? Sometimes urgency is real and you should pivot. Sometimes it's perceived urgency that doesn't justify disrupting planned work. Professional analysts facilitate informed decisions, not just execute orders. Help stakeholders understand trade-offs.

### Question 3
Which skills from CTS-285 will be most critical in CTS-289 (capstone)?

A) Only coding skills
B) Project planning, stakeholder communication, problem analysis, self-directed work
C) Only documentation skills
D) CTS-285 skills won't be relevant

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: CTS-289 gives minimal instructor guidance—you'll need to scope your project, communicate with stakeholders, make design decisions, manage your time, and deliver professionally. The PM and systems analysis skills from CTS-285 make you capable of independent work. Technical skills get you started; professional skills get you finished.

### Question 4
You're midway through a sprint and realize your initial design won't work. What should you do?

A) Continue with the broken design to avoid admitting the mistake
B) Acknowledge the issue, analyze the problem, propose alternatives, adjust the plan
C) Blame the requirements
D) Start over without telling anyone

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Designs evolve as you learn. Professional response: "Our initial approach has a scaling problem. Here are two alternatives and their trade-offs. This will add 2 days. Recommend we push feature X to next sprint." This transparency builds trust. Hiding problems until deadline creates disasters. Iterative development expects and accommodates learning.

### Question 5
What does it mean to "work autonomously" in a professional context?

A) Never asking for help
B) Managing your work, making informed decisions, and knowing when to seek input
C) Ignoring all guidelines and doing whatever you want
D) Working in complete isolation

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Autonomous doesn't mean alone. It means owning your work—planning tasks, solving problems, making decisions within your authority, and knowing when you need guidance. Junior developers ask before every decision. Professionals make informed choices independently and escalate when appropriate. This course develops that judgment.

### Question 6
You have limited time to complete a project. How should you prioritize features?

A) Try to build everything
B) Focus on highest business value features first using user stories to guide priority
C) Build the easiest features first
D) Build whatever you find most interesting

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Prioritize by value, not ease or interest. Which features deliver the most benefit to users? Start there. If you run out of time, you've built the core functionality. This is MVP thinking—deliver maximum value with minimum scope. Professional developers ship impactful partial systems over complete but low-value systems.

### Question 7
Which user story component helps you prioritize features?

A) The role
B) The feature description
C) The benefit clause ("so that...")
D) All components matter for prioritization

**Correct Answer**: C
**Explanation**: The "so that" clause reveals value. "So that customers can complete purchases faster" (high value—direct revenue impact) vs "so that the admin panel looks nicer" (lower value—no user impact). When prioritizing, ask: which benefits matter most right now? Features without clear benefits are candidates for cutting. Value drives priority.

### Question 8
You're presenting your completed project to stakeholders. What should you emphasize?

A) Every technical detail of implementation
B) How the solution solves their problems and delivers the promised value
C) How many hours you worked
D) All the features you didn't have time to build

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Stakeholders care about outcomes. "This reduces report generation from 10 minutes to 30 seconds, saving the team 5 hours per week" is meaningful. Technical details matter only if they affect decisions. Professional presentations translate technical work into business value. You're not showing off your code; you're demonstrating you solved their problem.

### Question 9
What's the relationship between all the SDLC phases in Agile development?

A) They happen once sequentially
B) They happen in iterative cycles within each sprint
C) They're completely separate processes
D) Only coding matters in Agile

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Agile doesn't skip SDLC phases—it cycles through them quickly. Each sprint includes analysis (refine requirements), design (plan approach), implementation (code), testing (verify), and review (stakeholder feedback). Then repeat. This rapid cycling enables learning and adaptation. Understanding this prepares you for real Agile work.

## Professional Practice & Integration Concepts (40%)

### Question 10
You're working on a project with unclear requirements. What's the best approach?

A) Make assumptions and proceed
B) Iterate—build something small, get feedback, learn, adjust, repeat
C) Wait for perfect requirements before starting
D) Build everything you can think of

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Uncertainty requires iterative approaches. Build a simple prototype, show stakeholders, learn what they actually need, refine. This is why Agile exists—to handle uncertainty. Perfect requirements are fantasy. Professional developers work with ambiguity by learning incrementally. Every iteration reduces uncertainty.

### Question 11
What makes a project "successful" in systems analysis?

A) Using the most complex technology
B) Delivering a solution that solves the actual problem and provides value to stakeholders
C) Finishing exactly on the original deadline
D) Writing the most code

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Success is solving problems and delivering value. A simple solution that works is better than a complex one that impresses technically but fails users. A project that ships late but delivers value succeeds. One that ships on time but doesn't solve the problem fails. In professional work, outcomes matter more than outputs.

### Question 12
You're facilitating a sprint retrospective. The team identifies several problems but no one wants to commit to changes. What should you do?

A) Skip improvements and move on
B) Help the team identify one small, achievable improvement to try in the next sprint
C) Force them to fix everything
D) Cancel retrospectives

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Start small. One improvement per sprint is better than ten ideas that never happen. "Let's try 30-minute standups instead of 15-minute ones next sprint and see if it helps" is achievable. Retrospectives without action items are pointless. Professional facilitators turn discussion into commitment. Small improvements compound over time.

### Question 13
What's the most important skill for working with minimal supervision (like in CTS-289)?

A) Being the fastest coder
B) Breaking work into manageable tasks, tracking progress, and communicating proactively
C) Never asking questions
D) Working as many hours as possible

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Self-management means planning your work, tracking what you've done, identifying blockers early, and communicating status without being asked. Fast coding doesn't matter if you're building the wrong thing. Working long hours doesn't matter if you're stuck and won't ask for help. Professional autonomy is about effective self-direction.

### Question 14
Looking back at CTS-285, which mindset will serve you best in your IT career?

A) Know everything before starting any project
B) Be curious, communicate clearly, learn from mistakes, and focus on delivering value
C) Avoid risk by never trying new approaches
D) Work in isolation to avoid feedback

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Professional success isn't about knowing everything—it's about learning continuously, communicating effectively, recovering from failures, and staying focused on value. Every project teaches you something. Every mistake is a learning opportunity if you reflect on it. The curiosity and communication skills from this course are career-long assets.

### Question 15
You've completed CTS-285. What should you focus on when starting your CTS-289 capstone project?

A) Using every technology and technique from the course
B) Choosing a meaningful problem, scoping it realistically, and applying course concepts appropriately
C) Making it as complex as possible to show your skills
D) Copying someone else's project

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Your capstone should demonstrate competence, not complexity. Choose a problem you care about, scope it to fit the timeframe, apply systems analysis and PM practices appropriately. A well-executed simple project is better than an over-scoped disaster. This is your professional portfolio piece—show you can plan, execute, and deliver real solutions.
