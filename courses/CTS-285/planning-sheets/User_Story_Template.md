# User Story Template
## CTS-285: Systems Analysis & Design

---

## Purpose

Write well-formed user stories that clearly communicate functionality from the user's perspective, with testable acceptance criteria.

---

## When to Use

Throughout the course, especially during requirements gathering (Weeks 3-4) and before sprint planning. Every feature should be a user story before it becomes code.

---

## Instructions

1. **Write from user perspective** - "As a [role]" not "The system shall"
2. **Focus on value** - "So that [benefit]" explains WHY the feature matters
3. **Keep stories small** - Should fit in one sprint (1-8 story points)
4. **Include acceptance criteria** - Use Given-When-Then format
5. **Estimate story points** - Use Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
6. **Prioritize with MoSCoW** - Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have
7. **Add notes** - Technical considerations, dependencies, risks

---

## Filled Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce

### User Story [US-012]

**Title**: Add product to shopping cart

**As a** customer
**I want** to add items to my shopping cart
**So that** I can purchase multiple products in a single transaction

---

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I am viewing a product detail page
**When** I click the "Add to Cart" button
**Then** the product is added to my cart and I see a confirmation message

**Given** I have items in my cart
**When** I add the same product again
**Then** the quantity increases by 1 instead of creating a duplicate entry

**Given** I add a product to my cart
**When** the product is out of stock
**Then** I see an error message and the product is not added to my cart

**Given** I am not logged in
**When** I add items to my cart
**Then** my cart persists after I log in or create an account

**Given** I have 10+ items in my cart
**When** I try to add an 11th item

## Why This Matters

User stories are the language of Agile software development. Every major tech company (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Airbnb) uses user stories to communicate requirements.

Why user stories work:

1. **User-centered** - Forces you to think about WHO uses the feature and WHY they need it
2. **Conversation starter** - Stories aren't complete specs, they're prompts for discussion
3. **Testable** - Acceptance criteria give you clear pass/fail tests
4. **Right-sized** - Stories are small enough to complete in a sprint
5. **Prioritizable** - MoSCoW method lets you defer nice-to-haves

**User stories replace traditional requirements documents** (100-page PDFs that nobody reads). Instead of:
> "The system shall provide functionality to allow authorized users to add products to a persistent shopping cart with validation of inventory levels and enforcement of cart item limits."

You write:
> **As a** customer, **I want** to add items to my cart, **So that** I can purchase multiple products together.

Second version is clearer, more human, and focuses on value.

The acceptance criteria are where details live. Given-When-Then format is standard because it's:
- **Specific**: Clear pass/fail conditions
- **Testable**: Can be automated as tests
- **User-focused**: Describes behavior from user perspective

**Story points** (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) are relative sizing, not hours:
- **1 point**: Trivial, 1-2 hours, no unknowns
- **3 points**: Standard story, half a day, well-understood
- **5 points**: Complex story, 1 day, some unknowns
- **8 points**: Very complex, 1-2 days, many unknowns
- **13 points**: Too big, break it down into smaller stories

Teams estimate story points together (Planning Poker) because group estimates are more accurate than individual estimates.

In CTS-289 (capstone), you'll write 40-60 user stories for your project. Students who write good stories build good software. Students who write vague requirements build the wrong thing.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Mistake**: Technical stories - "As a developer, I want to refactor the database schema"
  **Better approach**: Stories describe user value. Technical work is a task within a user-facing story, or a "spike" (research story) if it's pure exploration.

- **Mistake**: Vague acceptance criteria - "The feature works correctly"
  **Better approach**: Specific Given-When-Then scenarios you can test. "Works correctly" is subjective. "User sees confirmation message" is testable.

- **Mistake**: Giant stories - 13+ story points that take multiple sprints
  **Better approach**: Break into smaller stories. "Build shopping cart" becomes: Add item (5pts), Remove item (2pts), Update quantity (2pts), View cart (3pts).

- **Mistake**: No "so that" clause - just "As a user I want to submit forms"
  **Better approach**: Include the WHY. "So that I can provide information without calling support." If you can't explain why a feature matters, maybe it doesn't.

- **Mistake**: Missing edge cases in acceptance criteria - only testing happy path
  **Better approach**: Include error cases, boundary conditions, edge cases. What happens when data is invalid? When API is down? When user tries twice?

- **Mistake**: Stories dependent on implementation details - "As a user I want a PostgreSQL database"
  **Better approach**: Focus on outcomes, not technology. "As a user I want my data to persist across sessions" (how you store it is implementation detail).

## Integration with Course Project

In CTS-285, user stories are your requirements:

**Requirements**:
- Write 20-30 user stories for your semester project
- Each story includes: role, feature, benefit, acceptance criteria, story points, priority
- Submit user story backlog in Week 4 (before first sprint)
- Refine stories throughout semester as you learn more

**Grading criteria**:
- **Format** (20%): Follows "As a/I want/So that" format, includes Given-When-Then criteria
- **Clarity** (30%): Specific, unambiguous, testable
- **Completeness** (30%): Covers all major features, includes edge cases
- **Sizing** (20%): Story points are reasonable, stories fit in one sprint

**How to write stories for your project**:
1. **Week 3**: Brainstorm all features your system needs (don't filter yet)
2. **Week 3**: Group features into epics (Shopping Cart, User Auth, Admin Dashboard, etc.)
3. **Week 3**: Write user stories for each feature
4. **Week 4**: Add acceptance criteria (3-5 per story)
5. **Week 4**: Estimate story points as a team (or individually if solo project)
6. **Week 4**: Prioritize with MoSCoW
7. **Week 5**: Select Must Have stories for Sprint 1
8. **Throughout**: Refine stories as you learn more (living document)

**Professional user story practices**:
- **INVEST criteria**: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable
- **3 Cs**: Card (written on index card in physical Scrum), Conversation (story is discussion prompt), Confirmation (acceptance criteria)
- **Product Owner writes stories** but team refines them together
- **Stories evolve** - initial version is rough, gets refined during backlog grooming

**In professional development**:
- Product Manager or Product Owner writes stories
- Team estimates story points together in sprint planning
- Developers break stories into technical tasks
- QA writes test cases from acceptance criteria
- Stories are never "done" being refined until they're built

**This skill is career-critical. Employers don't expect new grads to be expert coders. They DO expect you to understand user stories, write clear requirements, and think from user perspective. Learn this now.**
