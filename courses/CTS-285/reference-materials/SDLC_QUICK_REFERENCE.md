**When** I enter valid email and password and click "Login"
**Then** I am redirected to my dashboard and see welcome message

**Given** I enter an invalid email format
**When** I click "Login"
**Then** I see error "Invalid email format"

**Given** I enter wrong password
**When** I click "Login"
**Then** I see error "Invalid credentials" (don't specify if email or password is wrong for security)

**Given** my account is locked (3 failed attempts)

**Then** I see "Account locked - reset your password"

---

#### Story Details
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Sprint**: Sprint 1
- **Dependencies**: US-001 (Database setup), US-002 (User registration)
```

### Example 2: E-commerce

**As a** customer
**I want** to add products to my cart
**So that** I can purchase multiple items together

---

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I am viewing a product page
**When** I click "Add to Cart"
**Then** the product is added to my cart and I see confirmation "Added to cart"

**Given** I add the same product twice
**When** I add it again
**Then** the quantity increases by 1 instead of duplicating the item

**Given** a product is out of stock
**When** I try to add it to cart
**Then** I see error "Out of stock - notify me when available"

**Given** my cart has 10 items (limit)
**When** I try to add an 11th item

---

#### Story Details
- **Story Points**: 5
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Sprint**: Sprint 2
- **Dependencies**: US-012 (Product catalog), US-013 (Cart database schema)
```

---

## 3. Acceptance Criteria Patterns

### Pattern 1: Form Validation

```gherkin
**Given** I am on the [form name] page
**When** I submit the form with [valid/invalid] data
**Then** I see [success message / error message]
```

**Example**:
```gherkin
**Given** I am on the registration form
**When** I submit with valid email, password (8+ chars), and matching confirmation
**Then** I see "Account created successfully - check email for verification"

**Given** I am on the registration form
**When** I submit with password shorter than 8 characters
**Then** I see error "Password must be at least 8 characters"
```

---

### Pattern 2: CRUD Operations

**Create**:
```gherkin
**Given** I have permission to create [entity]
**When** I submit valid data
**Then** the [entity] is created and I see confirmation
```

**Read**:
```gherkin
**Given** [entities] exist in the system
**When** I navigate to [list page]
**Then** I see all [entities] I have permission to view
```

**Update**:
```gherkin
**Given** I am viewing an existing [entity]
**When** I edit fields and save
**Then** the changes are saved and I see "Updated successfully"
```

**Delete**:
```gherkin
**Given** I am viewing an [entity] I own
**When** I click "Delete" and confirm
**Then** the [entity] is deleted and removed from the list
```

---

### Pattern 3: Authentication & Authorization

```gherkin
**Given** I am [logged in / not logged in]
**When** I try to access [protected resource]
**Then** I [see the resource / am redirected to login]
```

**Example**:
```gherkin
**Given** I am not logged in
**When** I try to access the dashboard page
**Then** I am redirected to the login page with message "Please log in to continue"

**Given** I am logged in as a regular user (not admin)
**When** I try to access the admin panel
**Then** I see "403 Forbidden - Insufficient permissions"
```

---

### Pattern 4: Error Handling

```gherkin
**Given** [error condition exists]
**When** [action is attempted]
**Then** I see user-friendly error message and system recovers gracefully
```

**Example**:
```gherkin
**Given** the database connection is lost
**When** I try to save my booking
**Then** I see "Service temporarily unavailable - try again in a moment" and my data is not lost
```

## 4. Story Point Estimation Guide

### Fibonacci Scale

| Points | Complexity | Time Estimate | Examples |
|--------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **1** | Trivial | 1-2 hours | Fix typo, update text, simple CSS change |
| **2** | Simple | 2-4 hours | Add validation, simple CRUD endpoint, basic form |
| **3** | Standard | 4-8 hours | Login page, list view with filtering, email template |
| **5** | Complex | 1-2 days | User registration with email verification, booking flow |
| **8** | Very Complex | 2-3 days | Authentication system, payment integration, reporting dashboard |
| **13** | Epic | 3-5 days | **Too big - break it down!** |
| **21+** | Too Large | **Always break down** | Never estimate this high |

---

### Estimation Examples

#### E-commerce System

| Story | Points | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Display product list | 2 | Simple DB query + template |
| Add product to cart | 5 | Multiple scenarios, cart logic, session management |
| Checkout flow | 8 | Payment integration, validation, confirmation email |
| Admin product management | 13 → Split | Break into: Add product (3), Edit product (2), Delete product (2), Image upload (5) |

#### Appointment Booking System

| Story | Points | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| View available time slots | 3 | DB query with filtering, calendar display |
| Book appointment | 5 | Validation, double-booking prevention, confirmation |
| Email confirmation | 3 | SendGrid integration, template, error handling |
| Admin dashboard | 13 → Split | Break into: View all bookings (5), Filter/search (3), Cancel booking (2), Export to CSV (3) |

---

### When to Add Story Points

**Add points for**:
- Complexity of logic
- Number of edge cases
- External dependencies (APIs, third-party services)
- Unknowns (learning new technology)
- Testing requirements

**Don't inflate points for**:
- Personal speed ("I work slowly")
- Distractions (meetings, other coursework)
- Team coordination overhead

**Use average team member as baseline** - not your fastest or slowest developer.

---

## 5. Sprint Ceremony Cheat Sheet

### Sprint Planning (2 hours for 2-week sprint)

**When**: Start of sprint (Week 5, 9, 13)

**Who**: Entire team + Product Owner

**Agenda**:
1. Review product backlog (15 min)
2. Define sprint goal (15 min)
3. Calculate capacity (15 min)
4. Select user stories (30 min)
5. Break stories into tasks (45 min)

**Outputs**: Sprint goal, sprint backlog, task breakdown

---

### Daily Standup (15 minutes)

**When**: Every day during sprint (async in CTS-285)

**Who**: Development team (Product Owner optional)

**Format**: Each person answers 3 questions:
1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. Any blockers?

**Rules**:
- Time-boxed to 15 minutes
- Not a problem-solving session (take problems offline)
- Focus on coordination, not status reporting

---

### Sprint Review (1 hour)

**When**: End of sprint (Week 6, 10, 14)

**Who**: Team + stakeholders (Andrew, classmates)

**Agenda**:
1. Demo completed user stories (30 min)
2. Gather stakeholder feedback (20 min)
3. Update product backlog (10 min)

**Rules**:
- Only demo stories that meet Definition of Done
- Live demo, not slide presentation
- Focus on functionality, not code

---

### Sprint Retrospective (45 minutes)

**When**: After sprint review, before next sprint planning

**Who**: Development team only (safe space)

**Agenda**:
1. Review previous retrospective action items (10 min)
2. What went well? (10 min)
3. What didn't go well? (10 min)
4. What will we improve? (10 min)
5. Define 3-5 action items with owners (5 min)

**Output**: Action items for next sprint

## 6. UML Diagram Quick Reference

### Class Diagram (Database Schema)

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│      Users          │
├─────────────────────┤
│ - id: int (PK)      │
│ - email: string     │
│ - password: string  │
│ - created_at: date  │
├─────────────────────┤
│ + register()        │
│ + login()           │
│ + reset_password()  │
└─────────────────────┘
         │
         │ 1
         │
         │ has many
         │
         ▼ *
┌─────────────────────┐
│    Appointments     │
├─────────────────────┤
│ - id: int (PK)      │
│ - user_id: int (FK) │
│ - date: date        │
│ - time: time        │
│ - status: string    │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Relationships**:
- `1` to `*` (one-to-many): One user has many appointments
- `1` to `1` (one-to-one): One user has one profile
- `*` to `*` (many-to-many): Many students enroll in many courses (needs junction table)

### Code Review Comments Template

**Approve**:
```
LGTM! (Looks Good To Me)
- Booking validation logic is solid
- Good test coverage
- Approved for merge
```

**Request Changes**:
```
Requesting changes:
- Line 45: SQL query is vulnerable to injection - use parameterized query
- Line 78: Function name `do_stuff()` is not descriptive - rename to `validate_booking()`
- Missing tests for edge case: what happens if date is in the past?

Otherwise looks good! Make these changes and I'll re-review.
```

**Ask Questions**:
```
A few questions before I approve:
- Line 32: Why are we using setTimeout here? Could this cause race condition?
- Line 56: Does this handle timezone conversion properly?
- Should we add logging here for debugging?
```

4. **Adapt to your project**: Examples are guides, not rigid rules
