## Course Overview

### Official Course Information

**Course Code**: CTS-285
**Course Title**: Systems Analysis & Design
**Credits**: 3 (2 Class | 2 Lab)
**Contact Hours**: 4 hours per week
**Prerequisites**: None (CTI-110, CTI-120, CTS-115 recommended)
**Status**: Active (NCCCS Combined Course Library)

### Course Description (NCCCS Official)

"This course introduces established and evolving methodologies for the analysis, design, and development of an information system. Emphasis is placed on system characteristics, managing projects, prototyping, CASE/OOM tools, and systems development life cycle phases. Upon completion, students should be able to analyze a problem and design an appropriate solution using a combination of tools and techniques."

### Our Implementation

**Experiential Approach**: Students build ONE information system across 16 weeks, progressing through complete SDLC while rotating through project roles.

**Modern Tool Stack**: Python/Flask, GitHub Projects, Figma, Draw.io (modern interpretation of CASE/OOM tools)

**Role Progression**: Observer → Product Owner → Scrum Master → Developer → Release Manager → Team Lead

**CTS-289 Preparation**: Scaffolds independent project execution and cross-functional collaboration (GRD-242 integration)

- 12-week (accelerated): Combine Modules 1-2, reduce sprint durations to 10 days
- 8-week (intensive): Not recommended (insufficient time for 3 complete sprints)

**For Different Modalities**:
- In-person: Activities as designed, synchronous standups
- Hybrid: Activities in-person, async standups via discussion board
- Online: Zoom for activities, async everything, require video presentations

**For Different Class Sizes**:
- 10-15 students (ideal): Individual projects, peer code reviews in class
- 20-30 students: Individual projects, online peer reviews, TA support recommended
- 30+ students: Not recommended without TA (grading load unsustainable)

### SME Instructor Support

Designed for SME (Subject Matter Expert) instructors without teaching training:

- **Clear rubrics** with "what earns full points" examples
- **Grading shortcuts** (GitHub Projects boards show process in 30 seconds)
- **Plain language** (no education jargon like "scaffolding" without definition)
- **Time estimates** (how long to grade each assignment)
- **Office hours scripts** (common questions with prepared answers)
