# CTS-289 Project Management Integration
## System Support Project - Capstone

---

## Purpose

CTS-289 is the culmination of the PM skills journey. Students **independently manage** their capstone project using all PM skills developed in CSC-113, CSC-114, and CTS-285.

**Process over Product**: Grading heavily emphasizes PM quality, not just technical deliverables.

✓ 6+ months of sprint experience (CSC-113, CSC-114, CTS-285)
✓ Fluency in Scrum ceremonies
✓ Story writing, estimation, velocity tracking
✓ Agile mindset and principles
✓ Stakeholder management basics
✓ Risk identification and mitigation
✓ MVP definition and release planning

### CTS-289 adds:

## Cross-Team Collaboration (GRD-242)

### Weeks 1-8 Focus: Designer Coordination

**PM Challenges**:
1. **Different schedules**: You're coding while they're designing
2. **Different tools**: They use Adobe, you use GitHub
3. **Handoffs**: When do they deliver assets? In what format?
4. **Feedback cycles**: How do you give constructive feedback?
5. **Changes**: What if their design doesn't match your technical constraints?

**PM Solutions**:
1. **Communication Plan**:
   - Weekly sync meetings
   - Slack/Discord channel
   - Clear deliverable dates
   - Feedback templates

2. **Dependency Tracking**:
   - GitHub Issues for "Waiting on Design" stories
   - Clear acceptance criteria for design assets
   - Backup plan if designs are delayed

3. **Integration Planning**:
   - Technical specs shared with designers early
   - Asset format requirements documented
   - Test integration before final delivery

**Deliverable**: Collaboration protocol document (Week 1)

**Assessment**: Quality of cross-team work (communication, integration, mutual respect)

---

## Adaptive Project Management

### When Plans Change (They Will!)

**Scenario 1**: "GRD didn't deliver the designs on time"
- **Response**: Activate backup plan (use placeholders, continue with other stories)
- **PM Practice**: Update sprint plan, communicate delay impact, adjust roadmap

**Scenario 2**: "This story I estimated at 5 points is actually 13 points"
- **Response**: Re-estimate, communicate scope impact, potentially cut lower-priority features
- **PM Practice**: Update backlog, discuss in retrospective, improve future estimates

**Scenario 3**: "I realized the MVP doesn't need feature X"
- **Response**: Reprioritize backlog, move story to "Won't Have" with justification
- **PM Practice**: Document decision rationale, communicate to stakeholders

**Scenario 4**: "Technical blocker: API doesn't support what I need"
- **Response**: Add to risk register, research alternatives, escalate if needed
- **PM Practice**: Update risk register, implement mitigation, document decision

**Assessment**: Students earn points for **handling change professionally**, not for following original plan perfectly.
