# CSC-114 Assessment Rubrics
## Artificial Intelligence I - Grading Standards

**Course**: CSC-114 AI I
**Instructor**: Drew Norris

- **Good (80-89%)**: Most requirements met, minor errors, adequate analysis
- **Satisfactory (70-79%)**: Basic requirements met, some errors, minimal analysis
- **Needs Improvement (<70%)**: Missing requirements, significant errors, incomplete

### Process/PM (7-8 points)
- **Excellent (90-100%)**: All PM artifacts complete, professional quality, evidence of learning
- **Good (80-89%)**: Most PM artifacts present, adequate quality

## Grading Policies

### Late Work
- 10% deduction per day late (up to 3 days)
- After 3 days: 50% maximum grade
- Sprint deliverables cannot be more than 1 week late (defeats sprint purpose)

### Revision Policy
- Assignments < 70%: One revision opportunity within 1 week
- Must meet with instructor to discuss improvements
- Maximum grade after revision: 85%

### Process Grading Philosophy
**Process points are NOT**:
- Busywork
- Optional extras
- Less important than technical

**Process points ARE**:
- Evidence of professional work habits
- Practice for capstone (CTS-289)
- Skills employers value
- Foundation for managing complex projects

### Velocity Expectations
**Sprint 1**: No expectations, establishing baseline
**Sprint 2**: Within 20% of Sprint 1 velocity
**Sprint 3+**: Velocity should stabilize (±10% variation is normal)

### Standups Expectations
- Minimum 8 of 10 days per sprint
- Brief (3 questions format)
- Honest (saying "struggled" is better than saying nothing)
