**Points**: 25
**Submission**: `sprint_2_retrospective.md`

## Sprint Review Demo
Present completed AI agents to instructor/peers:

- Discuss challenges encountered

## Sprint 2 Retrospective

### Key Questions
1. Did Sprint 1 action items improve Sprint 2?
2. How did velocity compare (Sprint 1: 12 pts vs. Sprint 2: ___ pts)?
3. What new insights emerged?
4. What's working well now that wasn't before?

### Velocity Trend Analysis
```
Sprint 1: 12 points
Sprint 2: [your points]
Average Velocity: (12 + Sprint2) / 2 = [calculate]

Sprint 3 Planning Guidance: Use average velocity
```

### Process Maturity
- Are standups habitual now?
- Is sprint board useful or just overhead?
- Are estimates getting more accurate?
- Do you trust your velocity?

## GRADING (25 points)
- Sprint review demo (10 pts)
- Retrospective depth (10 pts)
- Velocity analysis (3 pts)
- Action items for Sprint 3 (2 pts)

**Drew's Note**: Two sprints down! You're developing PM muscle memory. Sprint 3 (Modules 5-6) will feel smoother because you're not learning the process AND the content—the process is becoming automatic.
