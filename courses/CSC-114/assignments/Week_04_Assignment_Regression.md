# Week 4 Assignment: "Regression Analysis Project"
## CSC-114 AI I - Predicting Continuous Values

**Due**: End of Week 4 (Friday, 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 25
**Submission**: GitHub repository + Jupyter notebook

## ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Apply regression techniques to predict continuous values (house prices) and refine your story point estimation skills.

**Dataset**: California Housing Prices
**Goal**: Predict median house value based on features like location, age, rooms, etc.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. Implement linear regression and polynomial regression
2. Handle continuous target variables
3. Evaluate regression using R², MSE, MAE
4. Improve estimation accuracy with velocity data from Week 3

## REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION

### Models to Train
1. Linear Regression (baseline)
2. Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)
3. Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)
4. Polynomial Regression (degree 2)

### Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score (coefficient of determination)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Visualize: Predicted vs. Actual plots

## PM TASK: Refined Estimation

Using Week 3 velocity data:
- Estimate this week's stories
- Compare to Week 3 estimates for similar tasks
- Adjust based on learnings

**Velocity Tracking**:
- Week 3 Planned: 18 points
- Week 3 Actual: [your actual]
- Week 4 Planned: [based on Week 3 velocity]

## GRADING (25 points)

- Regression models (12 pts)
- Evaluation & comparison (8 pts)
- PM estimation tracking (3 pts)
- Documentation (2 pts)

**Submission**: Notebook + velocity tracking document

**Drew's Note**: Regression is everywhere in industry - predicting sales, user behavior, system performance. The PM tracking may feel tedious now, but by Week 8 you'll have accurate velocity data for sprint planning!
