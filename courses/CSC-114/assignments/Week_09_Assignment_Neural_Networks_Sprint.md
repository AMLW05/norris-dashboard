# Week 9-10 Assignment: "Neural Networks Sprint 3"
## CSC-114 AI I - Deep Learning Introduction

**Due**: End of Week 10 (Friday, 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 75 (Major Sprint)
**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks

## Technical Focus
- Build neural networks with TensorFlow/Keras
- Understand backpropagation and gradient descent
- Train deep learning models
- Tune hyperparameters

## Sprint 3 Planning
**Your Velocity**: Use 2-sprint average
**Sprint Goal**: "Implement functional neural networks for classification tasks"

## User Stories (Sample)
- Story 1: Basic Neural Network (MNIST digits) - 5 pts
- Story 2: Hyperparameter Tuning - 5 pts
- Story 3: Model Optimization - 5 pts
- Story 4: Performance Comparison (NN vs traditional ML) - 3 pts

## PM Deliverables
- Sprint planning, standups, burndown, retrospective
- Velocity tracking continues

**Drew's Note**: Neural networks are complex. Break stories small, ask for help early. Your PM skills will keep you organized when the tech gets hard!
