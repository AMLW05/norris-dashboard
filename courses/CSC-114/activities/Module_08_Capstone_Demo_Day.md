## Overview

**This is it.** Eight modules of learning. Eight sprints of building. Today, you show what you've built.

Demo Day isn't just about your ML model's accuracy. It's about telling the story: What problem did you solve? Who cares? How does it work? What did you learn? What would you do differently?

You'll present to three audiences today:
1. **Your peers** (fellow students who understand the technical details)
2. **Your instructor** (who will ask probing questions about your decisions)
3. **Yourselves** (reflecting on how much you've grown since Module 1)

**By the end of Demo Day, you'll:**
- Present a 10-minute technical demo with confidence
- Answer challenging questions about your project
- Provide thoughtful feedback to peers
- Recognize your own growth as an ML engineer
- Celebrate what you've accomplished

This is where learning becomes showcasing. Let's make it count.

## Demo Day Structure

### Timeline (120 minutes total)

**0-5 min**: Opening & Expectations
**5-95 min**: Team Presentations (6 teams × 15 min = 90 min)
  - 10 min presentation + demo
  - 5 min Q&A
**95-110 min**: Peer Feedback & Reflection
**110-120 min**: Instructor Closing & Celebration

---

## Part 1: Opening - Setting the Stage (5 minutes)

### Instructor Opening

**Set the tone:**

> "Welcome to Demo Day. Today is not about grades or judgment—it's about showcasing your journey. Every team here started eight weeks ago not knowing what a confusion matrix was, or how to train a neural network, or how to plan a sprint. Look how far you've come.
>
> As you watch each presentation, I want you thinking about three questions:
> 1. What problem does this project solve, and why does it matter?
> 2. What technical decisions did they make, and were they justified?
> 3. What can I learn from their process that I'll use in my own work?
>
> You'll have 10 minutes to present and 5 minutes for Q&A. We'll keep time strictly—this is practice for conference talks and client demos where you don't get extensions.
>
> Let's celebrate what you've built. Team 1, you're up."

---

## Part 2: Team Presentations (90 minutes)

### Presentation Structure (Recommended)

Each team has **10 minutes** for their presentation. Suggested structure:

**1. The Problem (1-2 minutes)**
- What real-world problem are you solving?
- Who is your user/customer?
- Why does this matter?
- Show a concrete example of the pain point

**Example:**
> "College students waste 20+ hours per week scrolling through irrelevant course recommendations. Our AI-powered course recommender analyzes your transcript, interests, and career goals to suggest the perfect courses for your next semester."

**2. The Solution (1 minute)**
- High-level overview of your ML system
- Key features (3-5 bullet points)
- Show a screenshot or architecture diagram

**3. Live Demo (3-4 minutes)**
- **MOST IMPORTANT PART**
- Show your system working with real inputs
- Narrate what's happening: "Now the model is predicting... You can see the confidence score here..."
- Have 2-3 demo scenarios prepared
- If demo breaks, have backup: recorded video or screenshots

**4. Technical Deep Dive (2-3 minutes)**
- What ML algorithms did you use and why?
- How did you handle data preparation/feature engineering?
- Architecture diagram (show layers, data flow)
- Key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
- What technical challenges did you face and how did you solve them?

**Example:**
> "We compared 5 classification algorithms. Random Forest won with 87% accuracy. We initially tried neural networks but they overfit on our small dataset. Transfer learning with ResNet50 didn't help because course data isn't visual. So we pivoted to ensemble methods with feature engineering on GPA, major, and historical course patterns."

**5. PM/Process Integration (1-2 minutes)**
- Show your Sprint board evolution (Sprint 1 → Sprint 8)
- Velocity chart: Did you get better at estimating?
- One key retrospective insight: What did you learn about working as a team?
- How did Scrum help or hurt your ML project?

**6. Lessons Learned (1 minute)**
- What would you do differently?
- What are you most proud of?
- One technical lesson learned
- One process lesson learned

**7. Q&A (5 minutes)**
- Audience asks questions
- Instructor may ask probing questions:
  - "Why did you choose X algorithm over Y?"
  - "How would you handle 100x more data?"
  - "What's your model's biggest weakness?"
  - "If you had 2 more weeks, what would you improve?"

## Part 3: Peer Feedback (15 minutes)

### Instructions

After all presentations, students complete peer feedback forms.

**Peer Feedback Form Template:**

```
Team Name: _______________________
Your Name: _______________________

1. What was most impressive about this project?

2. What was one technical decision they made that you thought was smart?

3. What's one thing they could improve (technical or presentation)?

4. On a scale of 1-5, how well did they explain:
   - The problem: ___
   - The technical solution: ___
   - Their process: ___

5. What's one thing you learned from their presentation that you'll use in your own work?

6. Overall impression (1-5 stars): ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐
```

**Instructions for students:**
- Be specific, not generic ("Good job" → "Your data visualization made the performance comparison immediately clear")
- Be kind, but honest
- Focus on what they can control (not "your voice is quiet"—that's not helpful feedback)
- Think like a conference reviewer: constructive criticism helps them improve

**Instructor collects and distributes feedback to teams after class.**

## Part 5: Instructor Closing & Celebration (10 minutes)

### Instructor Closing Remarks

**Themes to hit:**

**1. Recognize Growth**
> "Eight weeks ago, you struggled to set up Python environments. Today, you deployed ML models, handled imbalanced datasets, debugged overfitting, and fine-tuned neural networks. That's extraordinary growth."

**2. Normalize Struggle**
> "Every single team hit roadblocks. Models didn't converge. Data was messy. Sprints went over capacity. That's not failure—that's ML engineering. You learned to adapt, pivot, and solve problems. That's the skill."

**3. Celebrate Diversity of Projects**
> "I saw [list impressive aspects from each team's project]. Every team took the same concepts—classification, neural networks, evaluation metrics—and built something unique. That's creativity."

**4. PM Integration Success**
> "You didn't just learn ML. You learned to plan, estimate, retrospect, and collaborate. That's what makes you hireable. Companies need engineers who can both train models AND ship products."

**5. What's Next**
> "This is the beginning, not the end. ML is evolving faster than any field in tech. Here's how to keep learning:
> - Kaggle competitions (practice on real datasets)
> - Fast.ai courses (free, excellent deep learning content)
> - Papers with Code (see state-of-the-art research)
> - GitHub projects (contribute to open source ML)
> - Build things. Lots of things. Share them. Get feedback. Iterate."

**6. Final Words**
> "I'm proud of every team here. You've earned this. Now go build something amazing."

### Celebration

**Ideas:**
- **Certificates of Completion** (with each student's name and project)
- **Class Photo** (with team projects on screen behind them)
- **"Best Of" Awards** (voted by peers):
  - Best Demo
  - Most Creative Solution
  - Best Technical Execution
  - Best PM Integration
  - Most Improved Team
  - Best Presentation

- [ ] Reserve extra time if needed (some teams will run over)
- [ ] Have camera ready for photos
- [ ] Confirm all teams are ready (check in 24 hours before)

### During Demo Day

**As Facilitator:**
- **Keep time strictly**. At 9 minutes, give a 1-minute warning. At 10 minutes, politely interrupt.
- **Ask at least one question during each Q&A** (models engagement, prevents awkward silence)
- **Celebrate technical achievements loudly** ("That's really impressive that you debugged that overfitting issue!")
- **Make connections between projects** ("Team 3 used Random Forest, Team 5 used XGBoost—interesting comparison")
- **Encourage audience questions** (call on students if needed)
- **Take photos** (action shots of teams presenting)

**Questions to Ask (if needed):**
- "What was your biggest technical challenge?"
- "If you had 2 more weeks, what would you prioritize?"
- "How did you validate that your model wasn't overfitting?"
- "What data preprocessing step made the biggest difference?"
- "How would your model perform on completely different data?"
- "What PM practice helped your team the most?"

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Demo fails and team panics (help them pivot to backup)
- Team goes way over time (politely cut them off)
- Audience disengaged (call for questions, make it interactive)
- Team member not participating (ask them a direct question)
- Technical jargon overload (ask them to explain in simpler terms)

### After Demo Day

**Immediate (same day):**
- [ ] Compile and distribute peer feedback to teams

- [ ] Note standout projects for recommendation letters

**Within a week:**
- [ ] Grade presentations using rubric
- [ ] Write individual feedback for each team
- [ ] Collect reflection essays
- [ ] Update course materials based on what worked/didn't work

**Longer term:**
- [ ] Ask permission to showcase best projects on course website
- [ ] Encourage students to present at student research symposium
- [ ] Connect students with internship/job opportunities
- [ ] Write LinkedIn recommendations for standout students
- [ ] Document lessons learned for next semester

## Teaching Philosophy Notes

**Demo Day is validation.** Students have worked hard for 8 weeks. Many doubted themselves. Today they see: "I built this. I understand this. I can do this." That confidence is as important as the technical skills.

**Presentation skills matter.** The best ML engineer who can't explain their work is less valuable than the good ML engineer who can communicate clearly. Use Demo Day to reinforce: communication is a core competency.

**Process counts.** It's tempting to focus only on model accuracy. Resist. Ask about sprint planning, retrospectives, velocity. Show students that the PM skills they learned are professional skills that matter.

**Failure is part of the story.** Encourage teams to talk about what went wrong. "Our model initially got 60% accuracy, here's how we debugged it" is more compelling than "We got 95% on the first try" (which is probably a lie anyway).

**Peer feedback is a gift.** Students often give better, more actionable feedback than instructors because they're in the trenches together. Model how to give constructive feedback, and they'll internalize it.

**Celebrate.** Seriously. These students worked hard. They deserve recognition. Don't skip the celebration part. Print the certificates. Take the photos. Play the music. Make it memorable.
