## Compliance Status

### Launch Readiness: ✅ **APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Core Requirements (All Met)**:
- ✅ Complete assignment sequence (16/16)
- ✅ Comprehensive rubrics
- ✅ Clear learning outcomes
- ✅ Grading policies transparent
- ✅ Accessibility standards met
- ✅ Industry alignment verified

**Enhancement Recommendations**:
Completing high-priority items would elevate course from "Excellent" to "Exemplary"

---

## Innovation Highlights

### Novel Contributions to Course Design

1. **Dual-Assessment Model (70/30)**
   - First course in program to formally weight process skills at 30%
   - Creates accountability for PM practice without overwhelming technical focus
   - Model could be adopted across program

2. **Progressive PM Integration**
   - Solves the "PM skills gap" between CSC-113 and CTS-289
   - Mini-lesson format (10 minutes) respects class time constraints
   - Sprint structure aligns learning mode with content (managing ML projects via sprints)

3. **Process Portfolio as Capstone Component**
   - Makes PM growth visible and assessable
   - Creates valuable artifact for student portfolios
   - Demonstrates metacognitive development

4. **Velocity-Based Planning**
   - Teaches realistic project estimation (critical professional skill)
   - Uses students' own data for learning
   - Builds self-calibration ability

## Auditor Notes

### Strengths
This course represents **exceptional instructional design**. The PM integration is not an "add-on" but a fundamental reimagining of how technical skills and professional practices can be taught simultaneously. The sprint structure creates authentic learning experiences that mirror industry work.

The materials are comprehensive, well-organized, and demonstrate deep understanding of both ML content and Scrum methodology. Drew's voice creates genuine connection, and the progressive scaffolding respects students' developmental trajectory.

### Areas for Growth
The pending materials (templates, reference guides, activities) are the primary gap. These are relatively quick to create and would significantly enhance student support. The lack of peer collaboration in current assignments is a missed opportunity for social learning.

### Recommendation
**APPROVE FOR LAUNCH** with commitment to complete high-priority items. Course is already stronger than many fully-launched courses. The enhancement recommendations would elevate it to best-in-class status.
