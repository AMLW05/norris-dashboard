# CSC-114 Project Management Integration

## Purpose
Layer Scrum fundamentals into CSC-114 (AI I) to build on CSC-113's basic sprint/retrospective foundation. Students learn PM by managing their AI projects using industry-standard Scrum practices.

## PM Learning Outcomes for CSC-114
By the end of CSC-114, students will be able to:
1. Write effective user stories with acceptance criteria
2. Estimate work using story points
3. Plan and execute 2-week sprints using Scrum ceremonies
4. Track progress with burndown charts
5. Use GitHub Projects as a Kanban board
6. Run productive sprint retrospectives with action items

## Integration Approach

### Not a Separate Course
PM concepts are **embedded** in AI course modules:
- 5-10 minute mini-lessons introduce concepts
- Students immediately apply to their AI projects
- PM practices become part of workflow
- Process grading emphasizes PM quality

### Builds on CSC-113
Students already know:
- ✓ GitHub workflow (Issue → Branch → PR → Merge)
- ✓ Basic 2-week sprint cycles
- ✓ Simple retrospectives
- ✓ Commit messages as progress tracking

CSC-114 adds Scrum structure and estimation.

## Module-by-Module PM Integration

### Modules 1-2: Scrum Foundations
**PM Concept**: User Stories & Backlog Management
- **Mini-Lesson**: How to write user stories (10 min)
- **Application**: Convert AI project ideas into user stories
- **Artifact**: Product backlog in GitHub Issues
- **Assessment**: User story quality (part of module grade)

### Modules 3-4: Estimation & Planning
**PM Concept**: Story Points & Sprint Planning
- **Mini-Lesson**: Story point estimation (10 min)
- **Application**: Estimate all backlog items, plan first sprint
- **Artifact**: Sprint planning document
- **Assessment**: Estimation accuracy tracked over time

### Modules 5-6: Tracking & Daily Work
**PM Concept**: Burndown Charts & Standups
- **Mini-Lesson**: Visual progress tracking (10 min)
- **Application**: Daily standup logs, weekly burndown updates
- **Artifact**: Burndown chart, standup notes
- **Assessment**: Consistency of tracking

### Modules 7-8: Review & Retrospective
**PM Concept**: Sprint Review & Deep Retrospectives
- **Mini-Lesson**: Effective retrospectives (10 min)
- **Application**: Formal sprint review, structured retro
- **Artifact**: Retrospective with action items
- **Assessment**: Depth of reflection and improvements made

## PM Grading in CSC-114

### Process Points (25% of each module grade)
Each module includes PM practice assessment:
- **User Stories**: Clear, testable, properly formatted
- **Estimation**: Story points assigned, tracking velocity
- **Sprint Planning**: Realistic commitments, clear goals
- **Daily Work**: Consistent standups, updated board
- **Burndown Tracking**: Chart maintained, blockers noted
- **Retrospectives**: Honest reflection, actionable improvements

### PM Artifacts Required
- Product backlog (GitHub Issues)
- Sprint planning notes (markdown docs)
- Kanban board (GitHub Projects)
- Burndown charts (spreadsheet or chart)
- Daily standup logs (brief notes)
- Sprint retrospectives (structured template)

## Tools Used

### GitHub as PM Tool
- **Issues**: Product backlog (user stories)
- **Projects**: Kanban board (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- **Milestones**: Sprint markers
- **Labels**: Story points, priorities, types
- **Pull Requests**: Completed work for review

### Simple Tracking
- **Burndown**: Google Sheets template provided
- **Standup Log**: Markdown template in repo
- **Retro Notes**: Structured template (Start/Stop/Continue)

## Student PM Journey in CSC-114

### Week 1: Introduction to User Stories
Students learn user story format and convert 1-2 AI features into stories.

### Week 2: Build the Backlog
Students create full product backlog (10-15 stories) for their AI project.

### Week 3: Story Point Estimation
Students learn Fibonacci scale, estimate all backlog items.

### Week 4: First Sprint Planning
Students plan Sprint 1: select stories, set sprint goal, break into tasks.

### Week 5: Daily Standups Begin
Students post brief daily standups (What I did, What I'll do, Blockers).

### Week 6: Mid-Sprint Check
Students update burndown chart, adjust if needed, demo progress.

### Week 7: Sprint 1 Review & Retro
Students demo completed work, run first structured retrospective.

### Week 8: Sprint 2 Planning
Students apply retrospective insights to plan improved Sprint 2.

### Weeks 9-16: Repeat & Refine
Students continue sprint cycles, improving PM practices based on velocity data and retrospective insights.

## Connection to CTS-289 Capstone

CSC-114 PM skills directly prepare for capstone:
- CTS-289 requires self-managed project using Scrum
- Students arrive with 4+ sprints of experience
- Already comfortable with all Scrum ceremonies
- Can estimate accurately based on velocity history
- Know how to adapt when plans change

## Instructor Notes

### Time Investment
- **Prep**: 10 min mini-lesson per concept (8 total = 80 min)
- **Grading**: PM artifacts already exist (review during module grading)
- **Support**: Office hours help with PM questions alongside AI questions

### Drew's Pedagogy Fit
- **Process over Product**: PM practices ARE the process
- **Sacred Flow**: Expands GitHub workflow to full Scrum
- **Failure as Exercise**: Retrospectives normalize learning from mistakes
- **Iteration**: PM emphasizes continuous improvement

### Common Student Challenges
1. **Estimation**: First estimates are always wrong → normalize, track velocity
2. **Over-commitment**: Students plan too much → teach saying "no"
3. **Skipping Standups**: Make it lightweight, celebrate consistency
4. **Shallow Retros**: Model vulnerability, share your own mistakes

## Resources Provided

1. **Mini-Lesson Slides**: 8 slide decks (one per PM concept)
2. **Templates**: User story, sprint planning, standup log, retrospective
3. **Examples**: Sample artifacts from prior students
4. **Rubrics**: PM grading criteria for each module
5. **Quick Reference**: One-page Scrum cheat sheet
