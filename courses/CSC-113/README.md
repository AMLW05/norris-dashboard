## Drew's Pedagogical Approach

### Sacred Flow
Git workflow mastery: Issue → Branch → Commit → PR → Review → Merge

### Process Over Product
Grading emphasizes:
- Commit frequency and quality
- Pull request descriptions
- Documentation completeness
- Iteration and improvement

### Failure as Exercise
- "Bad Bot" assignment teaches through intentional failure
- Retrospectives focus on learning from mistakes
- "My Favorite Mistakes" culture

### Two Tracks
- **Code Builders**: Programming focus, technical implementation
- **Prompt Masters**: No-code focus, AI configuration and prompt design
