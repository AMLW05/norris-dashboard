## REGULATORY BACKGROUND

### Federal Definition: "Regular and Substantive Interaction"

Per 34 CFR § 600.2 (updated March 2020, clarified October 2022):

**"Regular interaction"** means:
- Predictable and scheduled
- Initiated by instructor (not just responsive)
- Occurs throughout the term (not just at beginning/end)

**"Substantive interaction"** means:
- Engagement with students on course content
- Monitoring student learning
- Providing feedback to improve learning
- Does NOT include only administrative tasks

**Between instructor and students** means:
- Actual faculty member (not just TA or automated system)
- Two-way communication (not just broadcast announcements)

---

## RSI COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### Criterion 1: Instructor-Initiated Interaction

**Requirement**: Instructor must initiate interaction (not just respond to student requests)

**Status**: ✅ **MET** - Multiple instructor-initiated touchpoints

**Evidence**:

#### 1.1 Pull Request Reviews (All 8 Modules)
- **Frequency**: Every assignment (16 total opportunities)
- **Initiative**: Instructor reviews PR before student can merge (proactive, not reactive)
- **Substantive**: Feedback on code quality, commit messages, documentation
- **Documented**: "Instructor commits to reviewing PRs within 48 hours" (Instructor Guide)

**Example Workflow**:
1. Student submits PR (assignment submission)
2. **Instructor reviews** (initiated by instructor, not student)
3. Instructor provides feedback via PR comments
4. Student revises based on feedback
5. Instructor approves merge or requests changes

**This interaction is**:
- ✅ Instructor-initiated (instructor seeks out PRs to review)
- ✅ Regular (every assignment, predictable schedule)
- ✅ Substantive (feedback on learning, not just grading)

---

#### 1.2 Weekly Exit Ticket Review & Response
- **Frequency**: Every 2 weeks (8 exit tickets per semester)
- **Initiative**: Instructor reviews all exit tickets and reaches out to struggling students
- **Substantive**: Instructor identifies blockers and provides targeted support
- **Documented**: Exit Ticket Template includes "Instructor reviews these weekly and follows up with students who request help"

**Example Workflow**:
1. Student submits exit ticket at end of module
2. **Instructor reviews all tickets** (proactive scan for struggling students)
3. Instructor contacts students showing confusion/difficulty
4. One-on-one support provided before next module begins

**This interaction is**:
- ✅ Instructor-initiated (instructor reviews and reaches out, not waiting for students to ask)
- ✅ Regular (every 2 weeks, predictable)
- ✅ Substantive (addressing learning challenges, providing guidance)

---

#### 1.3 Demo Day Facilitation & Feedback (Modules 6-8)
- **Frequency**: 3 times (weeks 11-12, 13-14, 15-16)
- **Initiative**: Instructor schedules demo days, provides live feedback during presentations
- **Substantive**: Critique of project work, suggestions for improvement, peer learning facilitation
- **Documented**: Activities files document demo day structure and instructor role

**Example Workflow**:
1. **Instructor schedules** demo day (synchronous session)
2. Students present project progress
3. **Instructor provides live feedback** (substantive evaluation)
4. Instructor facilitates peer questions/discussion
5. Instructor assigns action items for next sprint

**This interaction is**:
- ✅ Instructor-initiated (instructor schedules and facilitates, not optional student drop-in)
- ✅ Regular (3 scheduled times, predictable)
- ✅ Substantive (project critique, learning guidance, skill development)

---

#### 1.4 Sprint Retrospective Facilitation (Modules 6-7)
- **Frequency**: 2 times (end of sprints 1 and 2)
- **Initiative**: Instructor facilitates structured reflection sessions
- **Substantive**: Metacognitive development, process improvement, professional skill building
- **Documented**: Activities file includes retrospective facilitation guide

**Example Workflow**:
1. **Instructor facilitates** retrospective session (what worked, what didn't, what to improve)
2. Students share challenges and successes
3. **Instructor connects** student experiences to professional practices
4. Instructor helps students set goals for next sprint

**This interaction is**:
- ✅ Instructor-initiated (instructor runs session, not student-led)
- ✅ Regular (scheduled at end of each sprint)
- ✅ Substantive (reflective practice, professional development, learning improvement)

---

### Criterion 2: Substantive Interaction (Instructional Content)

**Requirement**: Interaction must engage students on course content and learning (not just administrative)

**Status**: ✅ **MET** - All interactions focus on learning, not administration

**Evidence**:

#### 2.1 PR Review Comments = Instructional Feedback
**Nature of Interaction**:
- Feedback on commit message quality (professional communication - CLO5)
- Guidance on prompt engineering techniques (CLO3)
- Discussion of AI evaluation criteria (CLO4)
- Coaching on GitHub workflow best practices (CLO1)

**NOT administrative** (e.g., "Your assignment is late" or "Please submit here")

**Example PR Comments** (from Instructor Guide):
- ✅ "Your commit messages are improving! Consider adding 'why' along with 'what' - explain the reasoning behind changes."
- ✅ "I notice your Good Bot still hallucinates on factual questions. Try adding 'cite sources' to your prompt and see if that improves accuracy."
- ✅ "Great use of branching! For your next assignment, try creating smaller, more frequent commits - it makes it easier to roll back if something breaks."

**These are substantive instructional interactions** (teaching, coaching, developing skills)

---

#### 2.2 Exit Ticket Responses = Learning Support
**Nature of Interaction**:
- Addressing conceptual confusion ("I don't understand why branches are useful")
- Troubleshooting learning obstacles ("I keep getting Git errors")
- Connecting to broader learning goals ("How does this relate to real jobs?")
- Encouraging growth mindset ("You said you're 'bad at AI' - let's reframe that")

**NOT administrative** (e.g., "I received your exit ticket" or "See you next week")

**Example Exit Ticket Responses** (from Instructor Guide):
- ✅ "You mentioned confusion about when to create issues vs branches. Think of issues as 'what needs to be done' and branches as 'where I'm doing it.' Issue = planning, Branch = execution. Does that help?"
- ✅ "I see you're struggling with prompt engineering. Let's meet in office hours this week - I want to walk through your Good Bot assignment and show you some techniques."

**These are substantive instructional interactions** (clarifying concepts, scaffolding learning)

---

#### 2.3 Demo Day Feedback = Project Critique & Guidance
**Nature of Interaction**:
- Evaluating project progress against learning outcomes
- Suggesting improvements to prompt design, AI configuration, documentation
- Connecting student work to industry practices
- Facilitating peer learning through comparison/discussion

**NOT administrative** (e.g., "Good job" or "You presented well")

**Example Demo Day Feedback** (from Activities file):
- ✅ "Your chatbot handles happy path well, but what happens when users ask off-topic questions? Consider adding guardrails to your prompt."
- ✅ "I love how you documented your prompt iterations! This is exactly what employers want to see - your thinking process, not just the final product."

**These are substantive instructional interactions** (developing critical thinking, professional judgment)

---

#### 2.4 Retrospective Facilitation = Metacognitive Development
**Nature of Interaction**:
- Helping students reflect on learning process (not just product)
- Teaching professional practices (sprint retrospectives are industry standard)
- Guiding improvement strategies
- Building self-awareness and growth mindset

**NOT administrative** (e.g., "How was your week?" or "Any questions?")

**Example Retrospective Questions** (from Activities file):
- ✅ "What's one thing you learned about AI this sprint that surprised you?"
- ✅ "Looking at your commit history, what patterns do you notice? Are you committing frequently enough?"
- ✅ "If you could redo this sprint, what would you do differently? Why?"

**These are substantive instructional interactions** (metacognition, professional skill development)

---

### Criterion 3: Regular Interaction (Predictable & Throughout Term)

**Requirement**: Interaction must occur regularly throughout the term, not sporadically

**Status**: ✅ **MET** - Interaction points scheduled every 1-2 weeks for entire 16-week term

**Evidence**:

#### 3.1 Interaction Calendar (16-Week Term)

| Week | Interaction Type | Initiative | Substantive Focus |
|------|------------------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | PR Review (A1) | Instructor | GitHub workflow feedback |
| 2 | PR Review (A2) + Exit Ticket | Instructor | SAGE setup feedback, module reflection |
| 3 | PR Review (A3) | Instructor | AI Timeline research feedback |
| 4 | PR Review (A4) + Exit Ticket | Instructor | Bad Bot analysis feedback, module reflection |
| 5 | PR Review (A5) | Instructor | Good Bot improvement feedback |
| 6 | PR Review (A6) + Exit Ticket | Instructor | Prompt engineering feedback, module reflection |
| 7 | PR Review (A7) | Instructor | Project ideation feedback |
| 8 | PR Review (A8) + Exit Ticket | Instructor | Track selection feedback, module reflection |
| 9-10 | Module 5: PR Reviews + Exit Ticket | Instructor | Prototyping feedback, sprint planning |
| 11-12 | Module 6: Demo Day + Retro + Exit Ticket | Instructor | Sprint 1 critique, process reflection |
| 13-14 | Module 7: Demo Day + Retro + Exit Ticket | Instructor | Sprint 2 critique, process reflection |
| 15-16 | Module 8: Demo Day + Portfolio Review + Exit Ticket | Instructor | Final presentation, portfolio defense |

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Interaction EVERY week (no gaps)
- ✅ Multiple touchpoints most weeks (PR review + exit ticket)
- ✅ Predictable schedule (students know when to expect feedback)
- ✅ Consistent throughout term (not front-loaded or back-loaded)

---

#### 3.2 Frequency Distribution

**Instructor-Initiated Interactions Per Student**:
- PR Reviews: 16 (2 per module × 8 modules)
- Exit Ticket Responses: 8 (1 per module)
- Demo Day Feedback: 3 (modules 6, 7, 8)
- Retrospective Facilitation: 2 (modules 6, 7)
- **TOTAL**: 29 instructor-initiated interactions per student over 16 weeks

**Average**: 1.8 substantive interactions per week (far exceeds "regular" requirement)

---

#### 3.3 Predictability Documentation

**Students know when to expect interaction**:
- Canvas syllabus states: "PRs reviewed within 48 hours"
- Exit Ticket template states: "Instructor reviews weekly and follows up"
- Demo Days scheduled in advance (calendar dates in Canvas)
- Office hours posted (consistent weekly times)

**Predictability = "Regular"** (students can plan around interaction schedule)

---

### Criterion 4: Between Instructor and Students

**Requirement**: Interaction must be with actual instructor (not TA, AI, or automated system)

**Status**: ✅ **MET** - All interactions facilitated by Drew Norris (instructor of record)

**Evidence**:

#### 4.1 Instructor Identification
- **Instructor of Record**: Drew Norris
- **Teaching Assistants**: None (course designed for single instructor)
- **Automated Systems**: None used for grading or feedback
- **AI Grading**: Explicitly rejected in Instructor Guide ("Process grading requires human judgment")

#### 4.2 Instructor Presence Documentation
- PR reviews signed by instructor GitHub account
- Exit ticket responses from instructor email
- Demo days facilitated live by instructor (synchronous presence)
- Retrospectives facilitated by instructor (documented in activities)

#### 4.3 Scalability Notes
- Course designed for 25-30 students (typical community college section)
- 29 interactions per student × 25 students = 725 interactions per semester
- Instructor Guide estimates 2-3 hours/week for PR reviews, 1 hour/week for exit tickets
- Feasible for single instructor (sustainable workload)

**No outsourcing to TAs or automation** = True instructor-student interaction

---

## COMPARISON TO MINIMUM COMPLIANCE

### Typical "Minimally Compliant" Course:
- 3-5 instructor-initiated interactions per semester
- Interactions may be generic (email announcements to whole class)
- Feedback generic or delayed
- Limited documentation of instructor presence

### CSC-113 Exceeds Minimum:
- **29 instructor-initiated interactions** per student per semester (vs. 3-5 minimum)
- **Individualized feedback** on every assignment (not generic)
- **Predictable schedule** (48-hour PR review turnaround)
- **Multiple modalities** (asynchronous PR reviews + synchronous demo days)
- **Comprehensive documentation** of interaction expectations and execution

**CSC-113 is not minimally compliant - it is exemplary.**

---

## ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE STRENGTHS

### Beyond RSI Requirements

#### 1. Office Hours (Additional Interaction Opportunity)
- **Frequency**: Weekly, consistent times
- **Initiative**: Instructor holds hours regardless of student attendance (not on-demand)
- **Substantive**: One-on-one learning support (not just administrative questions)
- **Documented**: Office hours schedule in Canvas, mentioned in assignments

**Note**: While office hours are student-initiated, they provide additional access beyond required instructor-initiated interactions.

---

#### 2. Discussion Forum Monitoring
- **Frequency**: Instructor checks forum daily
- **Initiative**: Instructor posts prompts to seed discussion ("My First GitHub Experience")
- **Substantive**: Instructor responds to student questions, facilitates peer learning
- **Documented**: Forum participation guidelines in Canvas

**Note**: Forum monitoring complements PR reviews (public vs. private interaction)

---

#### 3. Synchronous Lab Sessions (If Hybrid Format)
- **Frequency**: Weekly lab time (if hybrid delivery)
- **Initiative**: Instructor facilitates hands-on practice (Sacred Flow Lab, Prompt Engineering Lab)
- **Substantive**: Live coding, troubleshooting, skill demonstration
- **Documented**: Activities files include lab facilitation guides

**Note**: Lab sessions provide synchronous interaction beyond asynchronous PR reviews

---

## DOCUMENTATION AUDIT

### Required Documentation for Compliance

Federal regulations require documentation that RSI occurred (not just that it was planned).

#### CSC-113 Documentation Trail:

**1. Course Design Documents** (Proof RSI was planned):
- ✅ Instructor Guide documents interaction expectations
- ✅ COURSEMAP.md includes interaction points in each module
- ✅ Assignment instructions reference PR review process

**2. Interaction Records** (Proof RSI occurred):
- ✅ GitHub PR history (timestamps, comments, approvals)
- ✅ Exit ticket submissions (student responses + instructor follow-ups)
- ✅ Demo day attendance (recorded sessions if online)
- ✅ Retrospective notes (instructor facilitation documentation)

**3. Student Notification** (Proof students informed):
- ✅ Canvas syllabus states interaction expectations
- ✅ Assignment instructions explain PR review process
- ✅ Exit Ticket template explains instructor review
- ✅ Demo day invitations sent via Canvas calendar

**CSC-113 has complete documentation trail** for audit purposes.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Potential Compliance Concerns: NONE IDENTIFIED

#### Concern 1: "Is GitHub PR review truly instructor-initiated?"
**Answer**: YES. Students submit PR, but instructor must actively review and provide feedback. Student cannot merge without instructor approval. Instructor seeks out PRs to review (proactive, not reactive).

#### Concern 2: "Are exit tickets substantive or just administrative check-ins?"
**Answer**: SUBSTANTIVE. Exit Ticket Template asks learning-focused questions: "What did you learn? What blocked you? What do you need help with?" Instructor responses address learning, not just acknowledge receipt.

#### Concern 3: "Does 'regular' mean weekly?"
**Answer**: Regulations don't specify frequency, but CSC-113 averages 1.8 interactions/week (well above any reasonable interpretation of "regular").

#### Concern 4: "Are demo days required or optional?"
**Answer**: REQUIRED. Rubrics include demo day participation/presentation. Not optional student drop-in (which would be student-initiated, not instructor-initiated).

**No compliance concerns identified.**

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Maintaining Compliance:

#### 1. Document Everything
- ✅ Already done: GitHub PR history auto-documented
- ✅ Already done: Exit tickets saved in student portfolios
- **Action**: Save demo day recordings (if online) for documentation

#### 2. Consistent Execution
- Instructor must maintain 48-hour PR review turnaround (documented promise)
- Exit tickets must be reviewed every 2 weeks (documented schedule)
- Demo days must occur as scheduled (required for compliance)

#### 3. Audit Trail
- **Recommendation**: Run semester-end report showing interaction frequency per student
- GitHub API can pull PR review data (automated documentation)
- Canvas analytics can show exit ticket submission/response rates

#### 4. If Course Scales Beyond 30 Students
- **Concern**: Can instructor maintain 29 interactions per student?
- **Option A**: Cap enrollment at 30 (maintain quality)
- **Option B**: Add TA to assist with PR reviews (but instructor must still be primary reviewer for RSI compliance)
- **Option C**: Redesign to maintain interaction quality at larger scale

**Current design compliant for typical community college section size (25-30).**
