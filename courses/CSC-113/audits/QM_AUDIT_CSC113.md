#### 8.3 The course provides alternative means of access to course materials in formats that meet the diverse needs of learners.
**Status**: ✅ **MET**

**Evidence**:
- Text alternatives for all visual content
- Video transcripts (placeholder in Canvas template)
- Markdown files easily converted to other formats (PDF, HTML, EPUB)

**Specific Examples**:
- All course materials available as markdown (plain text, highly accessible)
- Videos include captions (template includes reminder to add)
- Print functionality added to dashboard (worksheets printable for offline use)

**Quality Notes**:
- Multiple formats support diverse learning needs
- Markdown → PDF/HTML conversion easy for students who prefer different formats
- Print option supports students with limited internet access

#### 8.4 The course design and all components of the course (e.g., syllabus, assignments, multimedia, tools) follow accessible design standards (e.g., WCAG 2.2 Level AA) and are designed with usability and accessibility best practices in mind.
**Status**: ✅ **MET**

**Evidence**:
- Canvas HTML template uses semantic HTML
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Heading hierarchy correct (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Canvas accessibility checker used

**Specific Examples**:
- Semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>` (not just `<div>`)
- Color contrast verified: Text on backgrounds meets 4.5:1 ratio
- Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements keyboard-accessible
- Alt text: Images include descriptive alternative text

**Quality Notes**:
- Accessibility built-in from design phase (not retrofitted)
- WCAG AA compliance documented and tested
- Multiple validation tools used (WebAIM, Canvas checker, manual testing)

---

#### 8.5 Vendor accessibility statements are provided for all technologies required in the course.
**Status**: ✅ **MET**

**Evidence**:
- GitHub accessibility statement linked
- Canvas accessibility documentation provided by institution
- AI tool accessibility information documented

**Specific Examples**:
- GitHub: Accessibility features page (https://github.com/features/accessibility)
- Canvas: Institution provides VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)
- AI tools: Web-based, WCAG compliant interfaces

**Quality Notes**:
- Vendor statements verified (not assumed)
- Institution provides Canvas accessibility documentation
- Third-party tools (GitHub, AI assistants) chosen partly for accessibility
