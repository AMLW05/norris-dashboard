# Instructor Notes: Activity Design Philosophy

### Active Over Passive
Every activity involves DOING (creating, testing, presenting), not just listening.

### Peer Interaction Built In
Most activities include pair work or group discussion. Learning is social.

### Checkpoints for Formative Assessment
Instructor circulates, checks understanding, intervenes before students get too lost.

### Connection to Assessments
Each activity scaffolds toward assignments. Activities = practice, Assignments = assessment.

### Flexibility
If activity runs long, it's OK to cut reflection time. If it runs short, use extension activities or early dismissal (students appreciate work time).

### Differentiation
- Fast finishers: Extension challenges (go deeper, help peers)
- Struggling students: Modified versions (simpler tasks, more scaffolding, 1-on-1 time)

### Documentation
Students should leave with artifacts (worksheets, drafts, notes) that help with assignments.
