## PHASE 1: Timeline Building (20 minutes)

### Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Divide into groups of 3-4 students**
2. **Distribute materials**: Each group gets:
   - Set of 40 shuffled timeline cards
   - Large poster paper or whiteboard space
   - Markers
3. **Explain task**: "You're going to build an AI history timeline from 1950-present. Place cards in chronological order and organize by theme."

### Group Work (15 minutes)

**Instructions for Students**:
1. **Sort cards by decade** (rough grouping first)
   - 1950s-1960s: AI foundations
   - 1970s-1980s: First AI winter, expert systems
   - 1990s-2000s: Machine learning, statistical methods
   - 2010s: Deep learning revolution
   - 2020s: Large language models, transformers

2. **Arrange chronologically within each decade**
   - Use smartphones to fact-check dates if needed
   - Discuss: Why did this happen when it did?

3. **Identify patterns**:
   - **Breakthroughs**: What made these possible?
   - **Winters**: What caused funding/interest to drop?
   - **Applications**: When did AI move from labs to products?

4. **Create visual timeline** on poster:
   - Draw horizontal timeline (1950 → 2025)
   - Place events above/below line by category
   - Use colors for categories (Foundation=Blue, Winter=Gray, Breakthrough=Green, Application=Orange)
   - Connect related events with arrows

**✅ Checkpoint (10 min)**: Instructor circulates, asks guiding questions:
- "Why do you think AI winters happened?"
- "What's the gap between breakthrough and application?"
- "Notice any acceleration in recent decades?"

---

## PHASE 2: Pattern Analysis (15 minutes)

### Group Discussion Prompts

**Each group discusses and records answers**:

**Question 1: Hype Cycles**
"AI has had multiple 'boom and bust' cycles. What pattern do you notice?"
- Initial hype → Unrealistic promises → Disappointment → Funding cuts → Quiet progress → New breakthrough

**Question 2: Decades of Progress**
"Compare progress speed: 1950s-1990s vs. 2000s-2020s. What changed?"
- Answers might include: More data, better compute, internet, different approaches (statistical ML vs. symbolic AI)

**Question 3: Applications Lag**
"Notice the gap between breakthrough and real-world application. Why does this happen?"
- Research ≠ productization, needs infrastructure, trust, cost reduction

**Question 4: Current Era**
"We're living through an AI boom NOW (2020s). Based on history, what should we expect?"
- Possible realistic excitement AND potential disappointments
- Some promises will be hype, some will transform industries

**Question 5: Future Prediction**
"What happens in the next 10 years? Use historical patterns to guess."
- Groups write 2-3 predictions on sticky notes

---

## PHASE 3: Gallery Walk & Discussion (15 minutes)

### Gallery Walk (10 minutes)

**Instructions**:
1. **Post timelines** on walls around room
2. **Students rotate** in groups (3 minutes per timeline)
3. **Observe differences**:
   - Did groups organize the same way?
   - What events did each group emphasize?
   - Different interpretations of "importance"?

**Discussion prompts at each station**:
- One event you find most significant on this timeline
- One event you'd add that's missing
- One pattern you notice

### Whole-Class Discussion (5 minutes)

**Drew facilitates**:
- "What surprised you most about AI history?"
- "Why is it important to know about AI winters when we're using AI tools today?"
- "How does understanding this history change how you think about ChatGPT/Claude?"

**Key Takeaway**: *History helps us have realistic expectations. AI is powerful but not magic. Knowing past limitations helps us use it better.*

---

## PHASE 4: Reflection & Connection (5 minutes)

### Individual Reflection

**Students write brief answers** (notebook or device):

1. **Most Interesting Milestone**: Which event surprised you or made you curious?

2. **Pattern Recognition**: What pattern in AI history will you remember?

3. **Connection to Assignment**: How will this activity help with your AI Timeline Research assignment?

### Assignment Connection

**Drew explains**:
"Your Module 2 Assignment asks you to research 10 AI milestones and create a visual timeline. This activity gave you:
- Exposure to major events (you can use these as starting points)
- Practice organizing chronologically
- Understanding of patterns to mention in your analysis
- Ideas for visual format

**You're not starting from scratch - you're building on today's work.**"

## INSTRUCTOR NOTES

### Learning Objectives Addressed
- **MLO 2.1**: Analyze AI evolution to identify key milestones ✓
- **CLO4**: Critically evaluate AI (through historical analysis) ✓
- Collaboration and communication skills ✓

### Differentiation Strategies

**For Struggling Students**:
- Pre-sort cards into decades for them (reduce cognitive load)
- Pair with stronger student who can explain events
- Provide year hints on more cards

**For Advanced Students**:
- Give them cards without dates - they must research
- Ask them to identify missing events and create new cards
- Have them analyze WHY certain events happened when they did (technological, economic, social factors)

### Common Misconceptions to Address

1. **"AI is brand new"**
   - Reality: AI research started 70+ years ago
   - Why it matters: Current tools build on decades of work

2. **"AI always progresses linearly"**
   - Reality: Boom/bust cycles, winters, unexpected breakthroughs
   - Why it matters: Today's hype may not equal tomorrow's reality

3. **"More complex = better"**
   - Reality: Deep Blue used brute force search, not sophisticated AI
   - Why it matters: Different problems need different approaches

### Discussion Facilitation Tips

**If discussion lags**:
- Ask specific students: "Your timeline shows [X], why did your group think that was important?"
- Use contrast: "Group 1 emphasized expert systems, Group 3 emphasized neural networks. Why the difference?"
- Bring in current events: "How does this historical pattern relate to ChatGPT's release?"

**If discussion dominates one student**:
- "Thanks [Name], let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet"
- Use written reflection first, then verbal (gives everyone processing time)

### Assessment (Formative)

**Observe during activity**:
- ✅ Are students engaging with content (reading cards, discussing)?
- ✅ Can they identify chronological order (basic understanding)?
- ✅ Are they making connections (why events relate)?
- ✅ Do reflections show deeper thinking or surface-level responses?

**Not graded, but informs**:
- Who needs more support for Assignment 2A?
- Which concepts to re-teach?
- Are students ready for critical analysis?

## EXTENSION ACTIVITIES

### For Groups That Finish Early

**Challenge 1: Add Missing Events**
Research and create 3 new timeline cards for events you think are missing. Write year, description, category.

**Challenge 2: Predict the Future**
Create 3 cards for 2025-2035. What AI milestones do you think will happen? Base predictions on historical patterns.

**Challenge 3: Controversy Cards**
Some AI developments were controversial (facial recognition, deepfakes, job automation). Create cards for ethical/social impact moments.

**Challenge 4: Regional Differences**
Most AI history focuses on US/UK. Research AI developments in other countries (China's AI investments, European AI ethics regulations, etc.). Add cards.
