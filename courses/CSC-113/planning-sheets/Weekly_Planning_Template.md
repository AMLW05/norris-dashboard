# Weekly Planning Template
## CSC-113: Planning Your Module Work

**Use this template at the start of each 2-week module**

---

## Why Plan Your Week?

**Without a plan**:
- "I have 2 weeks" turns into "OH NO IT'S DUE TOMORROW"
- You don't know what to work on first
- You forget small tasks until it's too late
- You feel overwhelmed and don't start

**With a plan**:
- You spread work across available time
- You know exactly what to do each day
- You catch problems early (can ask for help!)
- You feel in control and make progress

---

## The 2-Week Module Cycle

CSC-113 modules run for **2 weeks** (assignments due Friday of Week 2).

**Week 1**: Learn + Start
**Week 2**: Build + Finish

### Week 1 Pattern
- **Monday/Tuesday**: Read materials, watch videos
- **Wednesday/Thursday**: Start assignment, create issue/branch

## What Went Well / What to Improve

### What Went Well This Module:
1. Breaking work into small chunks made it feel manageable
2. Working a little each day instead of cramming
3. Asking for help early when git clone didn't work

### What I'll Do Differently Next Module:
1. Start Wednesday instead of Monday (give myself buffer)
2. Add 5-10 minutes to time estimates (I was slightly under)
3. Take better notes during the "learning day"

### Time Estimate Accuracy:
**Estimated total time**: 2.5 hours
**Actual total time**: 3 hours 10 minutes
**Difference**: Over by 40 minutes

**Why?** Didn't account for git setup confusion and extra proofreading time.

### Biggest Blocker:
Git clone command didn't work at first. Error message was confusing.

### How I Resolved It:
Asked in Discord. Someone pointed out I copied SSH URL but didn't have SSH key set up. Switched to HTTPS URL and it worked.
```

---

## Time Blocking Tips

### Find Your Best Working Time
**Morning person?** Schedule hard tasks before noon.
**Night owl?** Save focus work for evening.
**Lunch breaker?** Use 30-minute lunch sessions for small tasks.

### Block Specific Times
❌ **Vague**: "I'll work on this sometime Tuesday"
✅ **Specific**: "Tuesday 2:00-3:30 PM, CSC-113 work session"

### Protect Your Time Blocks
- Set phone timer/alarm
- Close Discord/social media
- Tell roommates "I'm working for 1 hour"
- Reward yourself after (snack, walk, game)

---

## Handling Unexpected Events

### "I got sick and missed 3 days"
**Solution**:
1. Look at your plan - what's critical?
2. Cut optional tasks (extra polish, nice-to-haves)
3. Ask for extension if needed (do this EARLY, not day-of)
4. Adjust next week's plan to prevent cramming

---

### "The assignment took way longer than expected"
**Solution**:
1. Check your task breakdown - did you miss something?
2. Ask for help - maybe you're doing it wrong way
3. Use weekend buffer time
4. Update your estimates for next module

---

### "I totally forgot about the assignment"
**Solution**:
1. DON'T PANIC
2. Create plan for remaining time
3. Focus on core requirements (skip extras)
4. Submit what you can
5. Learn from this - set calendar reminders for next module

---

## Integration with Other Planning Tools

### 1. Start with Task Breakdown
Break the assignment into specific tasks with time estimates.

### 2. Fill in Weekly Plan
Distribute tasks across 2 weeks using this template.

### 3. Create GitHub Issue
Copy tasks into issue checklist.

### 4. Execute Daily
Follow your plan, check off tasks, adjust as needed.

### 5. Use Exit Ticket
Reflect on how accurate your plan was.

## Common Planning Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: "I have 2 weeks, I'll start next week"
**Result**: Panic on Day 13
**Fix**: Start Week 1 Monday. Even 20 minutes counts.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Planning every detail too far ahead
**Result**: Plan changes, you feel behind
**Fix**: Plan Week 1 in detail, Week 2 in general. Adjust Week 2 based on Week 1 progress.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not scheduling WHEN you'll work
**Result**: "I'll do it later" → never happens
**Fix**: Block specific times. Treat them like appointments.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: No buffer time
**Result**: One small delay ruins entire plan
**Fix**: Always add weekend buffer or Thursday "catch-up" time.

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Ignoring your actual schedule
**Result**: Plan says 3 hours Tuesday, but you have work/practice/family stuff
**Fix**: Look at your REAL calendar first. Plan around commitments.

## Drew's Planning Philosophy

> **"A plan is not a prison. It's a tool."**

**Your plan will change**. That's normal and OK.

**Signs of a GOOD plan**:
- ✅ You know what to do each day
- ✅ You catch problems early (can adjust)
- ✅ You feel in control, not overwhelmed
- ✅ Work is spread out, not crammed

**Signs of a BAD plan**:
- ❌ So detailed it's rigid (no flexibility)
- ❌ Based on perfect conditions (no buffer)
- ❌ You avoid looking at it (feels like nagging)
- ❌ It doesn't match your real life

**Adjust your plan as you go. That's what professionals do.**

## Planning Evolution Across Modules

### Modules 1-2: Follow Template Closely
- Use this template exactly
- Plan every day of both weeks
- Track actual vs. estimated time
- Reflect on accuracy

**Goal**: Learn HOW to plan

---

### Modules 3-4: Customize Template
- Keep structure, adjust to your style
- You know your working patterns now
- Focus on critical path (what must happen when)

**Goal**: Make planning work for YOU

---

### Modules 5-8: Planning Becomes Natural
- You might not need full template anymore
- But you're still planning in your head
- Daily check-ins: "Am I on track?"
- Quick adjustments when needed

**Goal**: Planning is automatic habit

---

## Real-World Connection

**Professional developers plan sprints** (2-week work cycles):

**Sprint Planning Meeting**:
1. What are we building this sprint?
2. Break it into tasks
3. Estimate time per task
4. Assign tasks across team
5. Check in daily (standup)
6. Adjust plan as needed

**You're doing the same thing. Just solo.**

**Sprint planning is a $80k/year skill.** You're learning it in CSC-113.

---

## When to Update Your Plan

### Daily Check (30 seconds)
- Did I complete today's tasks?
- Am I on track overall?
- Do I need to adjust tomorrow's plan?

---

### Mid-Module Check (5 minutes)
**Friday of Week 1:**
- Am I 30-50% done?
- Are time estimates accurate?
- Do I need to adjust Week 2 plan?

---

### End-of-Module Check (10 minutes)
**After submitting:**
- Fill out "What went well / What to improve"
- Update time estimate accuracy
- Plan differently for next module

---

## Accountability Tools

### Share Your Plan
- Post in Discord: "My plan for Module 2"
- Study group: Share plans, check in
- Accountability partner: Text each other checkpoints

---

### Visual Progress
- Print your plan, check off tasks with pen
- Use GitHub Projects (kanban board)
- Sticky notes on wall
- Habit tracker app

---

### Rewards System
- Finish Friday Week 1 tasks → Treat yourself
- Complete 70% by Monday Week 2 → Small reward
- Submit on Thursday (early) → Big celebration

**You're more likely to follow your plan if there's a reward.**

---

## Summary: Weekly Planning Process

1. **Read assignment** (understand scope)
2. **Create task breakdown** (specific actions)
3. **Fill in weekly plan template** (distribute across 2 weeks)
4. **Block specific times** (when will you work?)
5. **Execute daily** (follow your plan)
6. **Adjust as needed** (plans change, that's OK)
7. **Reflect at end** (what worked? what didn't?)
8. **Apply learning to next module** (get better each time)

**Good plans lead to good work. Good work leads to good grades. Good grades lead to good jobs.**

**Start planning. Start shipping. Start succeeding.**
