# Task Breakdown Sheet
## CSC-113: Breaking Big Work Into Small Commits

**Use this sheet to break down assignments into manageable chunks**

---

## Why Break Down Tasks?

**Big Problem**: "Complete Module 1" feels overwhelming. You don't know where to start.

**Small Solution**: "Write README introduction (15 minutes)" is doable. You know exactly what to do next.

**Professional Skill**: Every software project gets broken into small tasks. You're learning how teams ship complex products on time.

---

## The 30-Minute Rule

**Target**: Each task should take 30-45 minutes max.

**Why?**
- You can focus for 30 minutes without burning out
- You can commit after each task (good version control habit)
- You can stop and come back without losing progress
- You see progress quickly (motivation!)

**If a task takes longer than 45 minutes**, break it down further.

---

## The Breakdown Formula

### Step 1: Read the Entire Assignment
Don't start working yet. Just read and understand what's being asked.

**Time**: 5-10 minutes

---

### Step 2: List the Major Deliverables
What files or products do you need to create?

**Example (Module 1):**
- [ ] README.md file
- [ ] GitHub issue
- [ ] Pull request
- [ ] SAGE workspace documentation

---

### Step 3: Break Each Deliverable Into Actions
For each file or product, list the specific actions needed.

**Example (README.md):**
- [ ] Write introduction paragraph
- [ ] Add "About Me" section
- [ ] List course goals
- [ ] Add contact information
- [ ] Proofread and format

**Time estimate each action**: 10-20 minutes each = 5 tasks total, ~1 hour

---

### Step 4: Order Your Tasks
Number them in the order you'll do them.

**Why order matters:**
- Some tasks depend on others (can't write reflection until you finish work)
- Starting with easier tasks builds momentum
- Ending with review tasks catches mistakes

---

## Task Breakdown Template

Copy this into your planning document:

```markdown
## Assignment: [Name]
**Due Date**: [Date]
**Estimated Total Time**: [Hours]

### Major Deliverables
1. [File/Product 1]
2. [File/Product 2]

## Time Estimation Tips

### Be Realistic
**Don't say**: "This will take 10 minutes" (then it takes 2 hours)
**Do say**: "I think 30 minutes, but might take 45" (build in buffer)

### Track Actual Time
As you work, note how long tasks ACTUALLY take:

```markdown
- [x] Write README intro (Est: 15 min | Actual: 22 min)
- [x] Add About Me (Est: 10 min | Actual: 8 min)
```

**Why?** You'll get better at estimating. This is a professional skill called "velocity tracking."

---

### Common Estimation Mistakes

❌ **Forgetting setup time** (opening files, finding resources)
❌ **Not including breaks** (you can't focus for 3 hours straight)
❌ **Ignoring interruptions** (someone asks a question, you check Discord)
❌ **Underestimating research** ("just look it up" can take 30 minutes)

✅ **Add 25% buffer time** to your estimates

**Example**: Task seems like 20 minutes → Estimate 25 minutes

## Module-Specific Breakdown Guides

### Module 1-2: Simple Assignments
**Pattern**: Read → Write → Review → Submit
**Average tasks per assignment**: 8-12 tasks
**Time per task**: 15-30 minutes
**Total time**: 2-3 hours

---

### Module 3-4: Research + Iteration
**Pattern**: Research → Draft → Test → Iterate → Document
**Average tasks per assignment**: 12-18 tasks
**Time per task**: 20-40 minutes
**Total time**: 4-6 hours

**Example (Bad Bot → Good Bot)**:
- Research phase: 4-5 tasks
- Design phase: 3-4 tasks
- Testing phase: 5-6 tasks
- Documentation: 3-4 tasks

---

### Module 5-6: Project Sprints
**Pattern**: Plan → Build → Test → Fix → Document → Review
**Average tasks per sprint**: 20-30 tasks
**Time per task**: 30-60 minutes
**Total time**: 10-15 hours (over 2 weeks)

**Break into daily chunks**:
- Day 1: Planning (3-4 tasks)
- Days 2-3: Core building (8-10 tasks)
- Days 4-5: Testing and fixes (6-8 tasks)
- Day 6: Documentation (4-5 tasks)
- Day 7: Review and polish (3-4 tasks)

---

### Module 7-8: Capstone
**Pattern**: Multi-week project, break into weekly goals
**Average tasks per week**: 15-20 tasks
**Time per week**: 8-12 hours
**Total time**: 25-35 hours (over 3-4 weeks)

**Break into weekly milestones**:
- Week 1: Core feature complete
- Week 2: Additional features + testing
- Week 3: Polish + documentation
- Week 4: Presentation prep

---

## Integration with Other Planning Tools

### 1. Start with Task Breakdown
Break assignment into specific actions with time estimates.

### 2. Create GitHub Issue
Copy your task list into issue checklist:
```markdown
## ✅ Checklist
- [ ] Write README intro (15 min)
- [ ] Add About Me section (10 min)
- [ ] Add course goals (10 min)
```

### 3. Work Through Tasks
Check them off as you go.

### 4. Use Exit Ticket
At end of module, reflect:
- **What Shipped**: List completed tasks
- **What Blocked Me**: Which tasks took longer? Why?
- **Next Commit**: What's the very next task?

---

## Practice Exercise

**Assignment**: Module 2 AI Timeline Research

**Your turn**: Break this down using the template.

**Deliverables**:
1. Research document (10 AI milestones)
2. Source citations
3. Timeline visualization (optional)
4. Reflection

**Fill in the blanks**:

```markdown
### Deliverable 1: Research Document
- [ ] _____________________________ (Est: ___ min)
- [ ] _____________________________ (Est: ___ min)
- [ ] _____________________________ (Est: ___ min)

### Deliverable 2: Source Citations
- [ ] _____________________________ (Est: ___ min)
- [ ] _____________________________ (Est: ___ min)
```

**Hint**: Think about the actions needed, not just "do the research."

**Example actions**:
- Find 3 credible sources about AI history
- Read articles and take notes on key dates
- Identify 10 most important milestones
- Write 2-3 sentences per milestone
- Format citations in proper format
- Proofread final document

**Each action = 1 task = 1 checkbox**

## Common Questions

### Q: "Do I really need to break down EVERYTHING?"
**A**: For Module 1-2, YES. You're building the habit. By Module 5, you'll do this automatically in your head.

### Q: "What if I finish a task faster than estimated?"
**A**: Great! Note the actual time. You're getting better at the work.

### Q: "What if a task takes WAY longer?"
**A**: Stop at 45 minutes. Ask for help or break it down further. Don't bang your head against a wall for 3 hours.

### Q: "Can I combine small tasks?"
**A**: Once you're experienced (Module 3+), yes. But in Module 1-2, practice breaking things down SMALLER, not bigger.

### Q: "This seems like busywork."
**A**: It's not. Professional developers do this daily. It's called "sprint planning" or "task estimation." You're learning a $70k/year skill.

## Grading Connection

**Drew grades your process, not just your product.**

**Good task breakdown shows**:
- ✅ You planned before diving in
- ✅ You understand the work required
- ✅ You can estimate time (professional skill)
- ✅ You worked incrementally (good commits)

**Poor task breakdown shows**:
- ❌ You rushed without planning
- ❌ You did everything last minute
- ❌ You don't understand the scope of work

**Task breakdown = evidence of thinking = better grade**

---

## Drew's Advice

> **"If you can't break it down, you don't understand it yet."**

**Stuck on breaking down a task?**
1. Re-read the assignment instructions
2. Look at the example projects
3. Ask yourself: "What's the very first action I'd take?"
4. Write that down
5. Ask: "What's the next action after that?"
6. Repeat until you reach the end

**Still stuck?**
- Ask in Discord: "I'm breaking down Module X. Should I...?"
- Come to office hours with your draft breakdown
- Look at past examples from other students (Canvas)

## Evolution Through CSC-113

### Module 1-2: Learn the Tool
- Use this template exactly
- Break everything down to 15-30 minute tasks
- Practice time estimation

### Module 3-4: Get Comfortable
- Still use template, but personalize it
- Start combining tiny tasks
- Estimate more accurately

### Module 5-8: Make It Yours
- You might not need the full template anymore
- But you're still breaking work down in your head
- Your GitHub issues show your breakdown
- Your commits reflect your task structure

**Goal**: By Module 8, this becomes automatic. You naturally think in small, shippable chunks.

---

## Real-World Connection

**In industry, developers break down "stories" into "tasks":**

**Story**: "User can log in with email"
**Tasks**:
- Create login form HTML (30 min)
- Add form validation (45 min)
- Connect to authentication API (60 min)
- Handle error messages (30 min)
- Write tests (45 min)
- Update documentation (20 min)

**Total**: ~4 hours (spread over multiple days)

**You're learning the same skill. Just with academic projects instead of production features.**

## Summary: The Task Breakdown Habit

1. **Read assignment completely** (don't start yet!)
2. **List major deliverables** (what files/products?)
3. **Break each deliverable into actions** (specific verbs!)
4. **Estimate time per action** (15-45 minutes each)
5. **Order your actions** (logical sequence)
6. **Work through one task at a time** (focus!)
7. **Commit after logical chunks** (3-5 tasks = 1 commit)
8. **Track actual time** (learn from reality)

**Start every module by breaking down the work. End every module by reviewing how accurate you were.**

**Small tasks → Small commits → Big progress → Great grade**
