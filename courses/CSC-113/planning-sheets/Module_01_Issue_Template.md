## Sacred Flow Connection

**Issues are Step 1** of the Sacred Flow:

```
1. Issue ← YOU ARE HERE
2. Branch
3. Commit
4. Push
5. Pull Request
6. Review
7. Merge
```

Every time you start work, create an issue first. This tracks:
- What you're doing
- Why you're doing it
- When it's done

---

## Module 1 Specific Notes

**This is your first time:**
- Creating a GitHub issue
- Using checkboxes in markdown
- Estimating time for tasks
- Tracking your own progress

**Don't worry about perfection.** The goal is to learn the process. Module 1 issues will be simpler than later modules.

**Questions?** Post in #module-01 channel or ask in this issue's comments.

**Remember:** Issues are for YOU. They help you:
- Stay organized
- Track progress
- Remember what's next
- Document blockers
- Reflect on learning

Start with this simple template. You'll add more complexity as you grow.
