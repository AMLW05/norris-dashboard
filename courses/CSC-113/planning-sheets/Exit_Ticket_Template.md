## Why Exit Tickets Matter

**For You:**
- Reinforces learning through reflection
- Tracks your progress over time
- Identifies patterns (what works, what doesn't)
- Builds metacognition (thinking about thinking)

**For Drew:**
- Shows your thought process
- Helps identify common struggles
- Guides what to emphasize in class
- Demonstrates growth beyond just code

**For Your Grade:**
- Part of process grading (not just product)
- Shows engagement and effort
- Counts toward participation
- Demonstrates continuous improvement

## Drew's Advice

### Common Mistakes:
❌ Rushing through it ("Nothing blocked me, everything's fine")
❌ Being vague ("I learned stuff")
❌ Skipping questions you can't answer
❌ Doing it all at once at semester end

### Success Strategies:
✅ Be honest (blockers are learning opportunities!)
✅ Be specific ("I learned the difference between features and labels in ML")
✅ Use it to actually reflect, not just check a box
✅ Complete it immediately after finishing module
✅ Review past exit tickets to see your growth

### The Real Goal:
Exit tickets aren't busywork. They're **process documentation**.

In the real world:
- Standups ask "What shipped? What's blocking? What's next?"
- Retrospectives ask "What did we learn? What should we improve?"
- Documentation requires explaining your thinking

You're practicing professional reflection habits.

## Example: Good vs. Bad Exit Tickets

### ❌ BAD Example:

**What Shipped:** Stuff
**What Blocked Me:** Nothing
**Next Commit:** Do next module
**What I Learned:** AI things

**Why it's bad:** Vague, no thought, no value

---

### ✅ GOOD Example:

**What Shipped:**
- Completed Hello GitHub - created repo, made 3 commits, merged first PR
- Started Meet Kevin assignment - compared Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini

**What Blocked Me:**
Technical issue - couldn't figure out how to create a branch at first. I was trying to do it in GitHub settings instead of the Code tab. Fixed it by rewatching the Sacred Flow video.

**Next Commit:**
Finish SAGE workspace setup - specifically create the prompt library file and add 5 example prompts

**What I Learned:**
I learned that branches are like parallel universes for your code. You can experiment without breaking the main version. This clicked when I accidentally broke my README and could just switch back to main to see the working version.

**Why it's good:** Specific, honest, reflective, shows learning
