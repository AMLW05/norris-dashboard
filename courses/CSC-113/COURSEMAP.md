## BLOOM'S TAXONOMY DISTRIBUTION

| Cognitive Level | MLOs | Percentage | Balance |
|-----------------|------|------------|---------|
| **Remember** | 0 | 0% | None (not assessed separately) |
| **Understand** | 0 | 0% | Embedded in higher levels |
| **Apply** | 11 | 46% | ████████████ Primary focus |

## INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN NOTES

### Backward Design Approach
1. **CLOs Defined First**: 5 course-level outcomes based on program needs
2. **MLOs Derived**: 24 module objectives (3 per module) explicitly linked to CLOs
3. **Assessments Aligned**: Every assessment maps to specific CLO(s)
4. **Activities Designed**: Learning activities scaffold toward assessment success

### Scaffolding Strategy
**Modules 1-4**: Foundation building
- Simple assignments (single file, clear instructions)
- High structure (templates, examples)
- Frequent low-stakes assessment (knowledge checks)

**Module 5**: Transition to project work
- First authentic task (prototype)
- More autonomy, less scaffolding
- Introduction of sprint methodology

**Modules 6-8**: Authentic practice
- Multi-week project with real deadlines
- Student-driven decisions (track choice, project scope)
- Professional-level documentation and presentation

### Differentiation (Two Tracks)
**Code Builders**: Programming focus
- Python/JavaScript implementation
- Technical documentation
- Code review and testing

**Prompt Masters**: No-code focus
- No-code tool configuration (Zapier, Airtable, etc.)
- Prompt library development
- Workflow automation and documentation

**Both tracks**:
- Same CLOs and MLOs
- Same core assignments (adapted to track)
- Same GitHub workflow and process grading
- Same portfolio requirements

### Active Learning Emphasis
- **Hands-on**: 70% of class time in lab/workshop mode
- **Minimal Lecture**: 10-15 min concept intro, then DO
- **Immediate Application**: Learn concept → Practice immediately
- **Iteration Culture**: "Fail fast, learn faster" philosophy

---

## COURSE POLICIES

### Attendance
**Hybrid Model**: Online materials + in-person lab
- Online readings/videos: Complete before class
- In-person lab: Attendance required for participation points
- Excused absences: Notify instructor within 24 hours

### Late Work
**Sacred Flow Exception**: If you follow Sacred Flow (create issue, branch, PR on time), you can request 24-hour extension with no penalty.

**Standard Late Policy**:
- 1-24 hours late: -10%
- 25-48 hours late: -20%
- 48+ hours late: -50%
- After Module 8: No late work accepted (end of term)

### Academic Integrity
**Collaboration Encouraged**:
- Discussing concepts with classmates
- Asking AI assistants to explain concepts
- Using official documentation
- Sharing troubleshooting tips

**Plagiarism Prohibited**:
- Copying someone else's work word-for-word
- Submitting AI-generated text without understanding or attribution
- Sharing complete assignment files
- Having someone else complete your work

**The Rule**: You must be able to explain everything you submit. If you can't explain it, you don't submit it.

**Consequences**: First offense: 0 on assignment + meeting. Second offense: F in course + academic conduct report.

### Accessibility
Students with documented disabilities should contact the Office of Accessibility Services and provide documentation to instructor within first week. Accommodations include:
- Extended time on assessments
- Alternative format materials
- Assistive technology support
- Flexible attendance policies

## INSTRUCTOR PHILOSOPHY: Drew's Approach

### Sacred Flow
> "Every professional developer uses version control. You will too."

The Issue → Branch → PR → Merge workflow is non-negotiable. It's practiced in every assignment, reinforced in every module, and graded as part of process.

### Process Over Product
> "I don't just grade what you built. I grade how you built it."

**What Drew looks at**:
- Commit frequency (did you work incrementally?)
- Commit quality (are messages descriptive?)
- PR descriptions (do you explain your thinking?)
- Reflection depth (do you learn from mistakes?)

**Why**: In industry, process determines success. Good process → Good product.

### Failure as Exercise
> "Bad Bot is my favorite assignment because everyone fails on purpose."

**Philosophy**: Controlled failure teaches more than easy success.
- Intentionally design failure (Bad Bot)
- Analyze why it failed
- Iterate to improvement (Good Bot)
- Celebrate the learning, not perfection

### Two Tracks, One Standard
> "You don't need to be a programmer to be AI-literate and work-ready."

**Prompt Masters** is not "easier." It's a different path to the same outcomes.
- Same rigor
- Same CLOs
- Same professional workflow
- Different technical implementation

## STUDENT SUCCESS TIPS

### From Past Students
1. **"Start Monday, not Thursday."** - Give yourself the full 2 weeks.
2. **"Commit early, commit often."** - Don't wait for perfect.
3. **"Ask questions in Discord."** - Someone else has the same question.
4. **"Use the planning sheets."** - They're not busywork; they help you ship on time.
5. **"Embrace Bad Bot."** - Learning what NOT to do is powerful.

### From Drew
1. **Follow Sacred Flow religiously** in Modules 1-4. It'll be automatic by Module 5.
2. **Read instructions completely before starting.** Skimming leads to rework.
3. **Use exit tickets honestly.** They help me help you.
4. **Pick a track that excites you.** Don't choose based on "easier."
5. **Your portfolio is your resume.** Treat it professionally from Day 1.

## COURSE EVOLUTION NOTES

### Changes from Previous Term
- **NEW**: Two-track system (Code Builders/Prompt Masters)
- **NEW**: Progressive PM planning sheets (intro level for CSC-113)
- **REVISED**: Module 8 now includes formal presentation
- **REVISED**: Process grading criteria made more explicit

### Continuous Improvement
Student feedback via exit tickets and end-of-course surveys informs:
- Assignment difficulty calibration
- Time estimate accuracy
- Material clarity and usefulness
- Tool selection and support
