# Module 4 Knowledge Check
## CSC-113: Project Ideation & Track Selection

**Purpose**: Verify understanding of project scoping, track differences, and professional goal-setting
**Format**: 10 questions
**Time**: ~15 minutes

---

## Questions

### 1. Project Ideation
**What makes a good project idea for CSC-113?**

A) The most technically complex project possible
B) A project that addresses a real problem you or others face
C) Copying an existing popular app exactly
D) Something that requires no AI at all

**Answer**: B - Good projects solve authentic problems. Complexity should match your skill level, not be overwhelming.

---

### 2. Problem Statement
**A well-defined problem statement should include:**

A) Only the solution you plan to build
B) The problem, who experiences it, and why it matters
C) A list of technologies you'll use
D) Your grade expectations

**Answer**: B - Problem statements focus on the PROBLEM (who, what, why), not the solution yet.

---

### 3. Track Selection
**Code Builders vs. Prompt Masters tracks:**

A) Are easy vs. hard difficulty levels
B) Are for programmers vs. non-programmers, with same learning outcomes
C) Have completely different course objectives
D) Require you to choose on Day 1 of the course

**Answer**: B - Both tracks achieve the same CLOs through different technical approaches. Choose based on interest, not "easier."

---

### 4. Code Builders Track
**Code Builders track emphasizes: (Select all)**

A) Python/JavaScript programming
B) No-code tool configuration
C) Code version control with GitHub
D) Avoiding any technical work
E) Testing and debugging code

**Answers**: A, C, E - Code Builders write and debug actual code, use Git professionally.

---

### 5. Prompt Masters Track
**Prompt Masters track focuses on: (Select all)**

A) No-code/low-code AI tools
B) Writing Python from scratch
C) Advanced prompt engineering
D) Workflow automation configuration
E) Avoiding all technical concepts

**Answers**: A, C, D - Prompt Masters use no-code tools but still do technical work: configuration, automation, advanced prompting.

---

### 6. MVP Definition
**What does MVP (Minimum Viable Product) mean?**

A) The most valuable product possible
B) The simplest version that solves the core problem
C) A product with maximum features
D) Your most valuable player on a team

**Answer**: B - MVP is the minimum feature set needed to test if your solution works. Add features later based on feedback.

---

### 7. Scope Creep
**"Scope creep" means:**

A) Moving slowly through a project
B) Continuously adding features beyond the original plan
C) Deleting features to simplify
D) Following your plan exactly

**Answer**: B - Scope creep is when projects expand beyond original goals, often causing delays. Stick to MVP first!

---

### 8. Feasibility Assessment
**When assessing project feasibility, consider: (Select all)**

A) Do I have time to complete this in 8 weeks?
B) What is the coolest sounding project title?
C) Do I have or can I learn the required skills?
D) Is this project's scope appropriate for my track?
E) Only whether it sounds impressive

**Answers**: A, C, D - Feasibility = realistic timeline, skill level, and appropriate scope. Not about impressiveness.

---

### 9. Elevator Pitch
**An elevator pitch for your project should:**

A) Take 10-15 minutes to fully explain
B) Be 30-60 seconds: problem + solution + why it matters
C) Focus only on technical implementation details
D) Include your entire resume

**Answer**: B - Elevator pitches are brief, compelling summaries. Hook listener, explain value quickly.

---

### 10. Learning Goals
**Why set personal learning goals for Modules 5-8?**

A) To impress the instructor with ambitious claims
B) To focus your efforts on skills you want to develop
C) Goals are unnecessary if you follow instructions
D) To make the course harder for yourself

**Answer**: B - Learning goals help you get more from the project by focusing on skills you want to grow.

---

## Short Answer

### 11. Project Idea Refinement
**Initial idea: "An AI that helps students."**

**This is too vague. Refine it by answering:**
- WHICH students? (Grade level, subject, context)
- WHAT specific problem? (Studying? Organization? Concept understanding?)
- HOW will AI help? (Tutoring? Flashcards? Study plans?)

**Sample Refined Idea**: "An AI tutor that helps college biology students understand complex diagrams by explaining each component in plain language and testing comprehension with generated quiz questions."

---

### 12. Track Justification
**Write 2-3 sentences explaining which track you're leaning toward (Code Builders or Prompt Masters) and WHY it aligns with your goals.**

**Good Answer Elements**:
- Clear track choice with rationale
- Connection to career/personal goals
- Honest about skill level and interests
- Specific about what you want to learn

---

### 13. Feasibility Check
**Idea: "Build an AI that writes full novels indistinguishable from human authors in any genre."**

**Is this feasible for an 8-week CSC-113 project? Why or why not? If not, how would you scope it down?**

**Good Answer**:
Not feasible - too ambitious in scope and technical complexity. Current AI can't truly write full novels "indistinguishable" from humans.

**Scoped Version**: "Build an AI creative writing assistant that helps users develop character profiles, plot outlines, and generate scene drafts for short stories (1000-2000 words). Focus on one genre."
