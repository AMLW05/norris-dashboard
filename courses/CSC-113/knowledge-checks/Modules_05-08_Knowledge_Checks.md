# Modules 5-8 Knowledge Checks
## CSC-113: Project Execution Phase

**Note**: Modules 5-8 are project-focused, so knowledge checks are lighter and more applied.

---

# Module 5 Knowledge Check
## Rapid Prototyping

**Time**: ~10 minutes

### 1. PRD Purpose
**What is a Product Requirements Document (PRD)?**

A) A document that lists programming requirements
B) A blueprint describing what you're building, why, and for whom
C) A grading rubric
D) A marketing brochure

**Answer**: B

---

### 2. PRD Components
**Which should a PRD include? (Select all)**

A) Problem statement
B) Your personal diary entries
C) Target user description
D) Feature list with priorities
E) Success criteria
F) Every possible future feature

**Answers**: A, C, D, E - PRDs focus on scope, users, features, and success metrics. Not personal info or unlimited future plans.

---

### 3. Prototype vs. Final Product
**A prototype should:**

A) Be 100% polished and bug-free
B) Demonstrate core functionality, even if rough around edges
C) Include every possible feature
D) Never be shown to anyone

**Answer**: B - Prototypes prove concepts work. Polish comes later.

---

### 4. MVP Features
**How do you decide what features go in MVP vs. "nice to have"?**

A) Include everything you can think of
B) Only features absolutely necessary to solve the core problem
C) Whatever is easiest to build
D) Random selection

**Answer**: B - MVP = minimum features needed to test if solution works.

---

### 5. AI-Assisted Development
**When using AI to help with development, you should: (Select all)**

A) Test and understand all AI-generated code/config
B) Copy-paste without reading
C) Document what AI tools you used and how
D) Assume AI output is always perfect
E) Iterate on AI outputs to improve them

**Answers**: A, C, E - Always understand and test AI outputs. Document your process. Iterate to improve.

---

### Short Answer 6-8:

**6. Feature Prioritization**
**You have 10 feature ideas but only time for 3 in your prototype. How do you choose which 3?**

Good answer: Choose features that (1) directly solve core problem, (2) are essential for MVP testing, (3) are feasible in time available. Nice-to-haves wait for Sprint 2.

---

**7. PRD Excerpt**
**Write 2-3 sentences for a PRD Problem Statement about YOUR project idea.**

Should include: Who has the problem, what the problem is, why it matters.

---

**8. Testing Plan**
**How will you know if your prototype works? Describe 2-3 tests you'll run.**

Good answer: Specific tests tied to success criteria. E.g., "Test if AI correctly categorizes 10 sample inputs" or "Have 3 users try the workflow and complete task successfully."

---

**Feedback**: Modules 5-8 are practice-heavy. These checks ensure you understand frameworks (PRD, sprints, retrospectives) before applying them.

---

# Module 6 Knowledge Check
## Sprint 1 & Retrospectives

**Time**: ~10 minutes

---

### 2. Sprint Planning
**Sprint planning involves: (Select all)**

A) Selecting which tasks to complete this sprint
B) Estimating time for each task
C) Completing all work for the entire project
D) Defining "done" criteria
E) Ignoring past velocity data

**Answers**: A, B, D - Planning = select tasks, estimate time, define done. Don't plan entire project in one sprint.

---

### 3. Daily Standup Questions
**Traditional standup asks 3 questions. What are they?**

A) What's for lunch? / Are we done? / Who's in trouble?
B) What did I ship yesterday? / What will I ship today? / What's blocking me?
C) How many hours did I work? / How many left? / Is it Friday yet?
D) Did I commit? / Did I push? / Did I merge?

**Answer**: B - Standup = shipped, will ship, blockers. (Module 1 Exit Tickets use similar format!)

---

### 4. Retrospective Purpose
**Why hold a sprint retrospective?**

A) To blame people for what went wrong
B) To reflect on process and identify improvements for next sprint
C) To grade team members
D) To celebrate only successes and ignore failures

**Answer**: B - Retros are about process improvement, not blame.

---

### 5. Retrospective Format
**A good retrospective covers: (Select all)**

A) What went well (keep doing)
B) Personal attacks on team members
C) What didn't work (stop doing or improve)
D) What to try next sprint (actions)
E) Velocity analysis (estimated vs. actual)

**Answers**: A, C, D, E - Retros are constructive: celebrate wins, analyze challenges, plan improvements.

---

### Short Answer 6-8:

**6. Velocity Reflection**
**You estimated 12 hours of work for Sprint 1. It actually took 18 hours. What does this tell you? How would you adjust for Sprint 2?**

Good answer: Underestimated complexity or encountered unexpected blockers. For Sprint 2: Reduce task load OR add buffer time OR break tasks smaller to improve estimates.

---

**7. Sprint 1 Retrospective**
**Write a brief retrospective for your Sprint 1:**
- What shipped?
- What blocked you?
- What will you do differently in Sprint 2?

Should be specific to your actual Sprint 1 experience.

---

**8. Demo Preparation**
**You're presenting Sprint 1 in demo day. What should you show? (2-3 sentences)**

Good answer: Working features (even if rough), explain problem being solved, demonstrate functionality with examples, acknowledge what's not done yet.

---

---

### 2. Applying Velocity
**Why track velocity (estimated vs. actual time)?**

## Modules 5-8 Feedback Summary

These knowledge checks are lighter than Modules 1-4 because Modules 5-8 are project-execution heavy. The checks ensure you:
- Understand frameworks (PRD, sprints, retros)
- Can apply concepts to YOUR project
- Reflect on process, not just product
- Prepare for professional presentation

**You're not just building a project - you're learning to work like a professional developer.**
