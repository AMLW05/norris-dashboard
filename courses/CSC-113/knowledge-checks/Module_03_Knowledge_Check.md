## Questions

### 1. Prompt Engineering Definition
**What is prompt engineering?**

A) Writing code prompts for programming
B) Designing and refining input instructions to get better AI outputs
C) Engineering AI systems from scratch
D) Debugging AI software errors

**Answer**: B - Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting, testing, and refining how you ask AI tools to get optimal results.

---

### 2. Context in Prompts
**Why is providing context important in AI prompts?**

A) It makes the prompt longer and more impressive
B) It helps the AI understand your specific situation and tailor responses
C) It's required by the AI to function
D) It slows down the AI to produce better results

**Answer**: B - Context helps AI understand your goals, constraints, and needs, leading to more relevant responses.

---

### 3. Prompt Engineering Techniques
**Which are effective prompt engineering techniques? (Select all)**

A) Be specific and detailed
B) Use vague language to let AI be creative
C) Provide examples of desired output
D) Include role/persona for the AI
E) Give contradictory instructions to test AI
F) Specify format/structure for responses

**Answers**: A, C, D, F - Specificity, examples, role-setting, and format guidance improve outputs. Vagueness and contradictions reduce quality.

---

### 4. Iterative Refinement
**What does "iterative refinement" mean in prompt engineering?**

A) Writing the perfect prompt on the first try
B) Testing, analyzing results, and improving prompts based on what works
C) Using the same prompt repeatedly without changes
D) Giving up after the first attempt fails

**Answer**: B - Iteration means continuous improvement: try → evaluate → refine → repeat.

---

### 5. Few-Shot Prompting
**What is "few-shot prompting"?**

A) Giving the AI very short, minimal prompts
B) Providing a few example input-output pairs before your actual question
C) Asking multiple questions in one prompt
D) Using the AI only a few times before switching

**Answer**: B - Few-shot prompting provides 2-3 examples showing the AI what kind of response you want, then asks your actual question.

---

### 6. Evaluating AI Outputs
**When evaluating AI-generated content, what should you check? (Select all)**

A) Factual accuracy
B) Relevance to your question
C) Bias or problematic assumptions
D) Only if it sounds confident
E) Completeness of the answer
F) Consistency with other responses

**Answers**: A, B, C, E, F - All except D. Confident-sounding output can still be wrong ("hallucinations").

---

### 7. Good Bot vs Bad Bot
**What should improve from Bad Bot to Good Bot?**

A) Speed of responses only
B) Clarity of prompts, context quality, and output relevance
C) Number of features (more is always better)
D) Length of responses (longer is always better)

**Answer**: B - Focus on quality improvements: better prompts, clearer context, more relevant outputs. Quantity (features, length) isn't the goal.

---

### 8. Role-Based Prompting
**"You are an experienced teacher explaining AI concepts to beginners." This is an example of:**

A) Context setting
B) Role-based prompting (persona)
C) Few-shot learning
D) Constraint definition

**Answer**: B - Setting a role/persona helps the AI adopt an appropriate tone, style, and level of explanation.

---

### 9. Prompt Constraints
**Why might you add constraints to a prompt? (e.g., "Respond in 3 bullet points")**

A) To make the AI work harder
B) To control output format and length for your specific use case
C) Constraints always reduce output quality
D) To test if the AI will follow directions

**Answer**: B - Constraints ensure the output fits your needs (brevity, format, structure). Well-chosen constraints improve usability.

---

### 10. Real-World Application
**You're using AI to research holiday gifts. Which prompt is better engineered?**

**Prompt A**: "Gift ideas"

**Prompt B**: "I need 5 gift ideas for a 30-year-old who enjoys hiking and photography, budget $50-$150 per gift. For each gift, explain why it fits their interests and include approximate price."

**Answer**: Prompt B

**Why**: Specific recipient, clear interests, budget constraints, desired output format (5 ideas with explanations and prices). Prompt A is too vague.

## Short Answer Questions

### 11. Iteration Example
**Your initial prompt to an AI: "Write about climate change." The response is too general and doesn't match your needs (you wanted specific policy recommendations for cities). Write an improved prompt that incorporates what you learned from the first attempt.**

**Good Answer Elements**:
- Specific focus (policy recommendations)
- Clear audience (cities/municipal government)
- Format specification (e.g., numbered list, brief explanations)
- Context (why this matters, who will use it)

**Sample**: "Provide 5 specific climate change policy recommendations for mid-sized cities (100k-500k population). For each policy, include implementation steps, estimated costs, and expected impact. Format as a numbered list with 2-3 sentences per policy."

---

### 12. Bad Bot → Good Bot
**Your Bad Bot for a recipe assistant gives recipes that ignore dietary restrictions you specified. Identify 2 specific improvements you would make for Good Bot's configuration.**

**Good Answer Elements**:
- Improvement 1: Add clear dietary restrictions to system context
- Improvement 2: Include examples of acceptable/unacceptable ingredients
- Could also add: Constraint to always list allergens, output format for ingredients, etc.

---

### 13. Evaluation Practice
**An AI gives you this fact: "The Eiffel Tower is 1,500 feet tall." How would you evaluate this claim? What steps would you take?**

**Good Answer**:
- Cross-reference with credible sources (official site, encyclopedias)
- Check multiple sources for consistency
- Note: The AI is close but not exactly right (actual height varies by measurement point: 1,063 ft to antenna)
- Mark for correction in your work
- Understand this demonstrates AI can be confidently wrong
